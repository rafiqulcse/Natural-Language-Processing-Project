Miss Hoover,"No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."
Lisa Simpson,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Miss Hoover,I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
Lisa Simpson,That life is worth living.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?"
Martin Prince,I don't think there's anything left to say.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart?
Bart Simpson,Victory party under the slide!
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Landlady,"Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume."
Lisa Simpson,Do you know where I could find him?
Landlady,I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
Lisa Simpson,"The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
Landlady,"Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point."
Lisa Simpson,"I see he touched you, too."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, thanks for your vote, man."
Nelson Muntz,I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
Bart Simpson,"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
Terri/sherri,We forgot.
Bart Simpson,"Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,Lewis?
Bart Simpson,Somebody must have voted.
Milhouse Van Houten,"What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?"
Bart Simpson,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,
Wendell Borton,Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
Bart Simpson,I demand a recount.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin."
Kid Reporter,"This way, Mister President!"
Conductor,"Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, and?›ƒ?ª??.."
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!"
BERGSTROM,"Hey, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Lisa, indeed."
BERGSTROM,What? What is it?
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
BERGSTROM,"Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what."
Lisa Simpson,You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
BERGSTROM,"Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who..."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, please."
BERGSTROM,"No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City."
Lisa Simpson,But I need you too.
BERGSTROM,That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
Lisa Simpson,"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
BERGSTROM,I'll tell you what...
BERGSTROM,"Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
Conductor,All aboard!
Lisa Simpson,"So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
BERGSTROM,"Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note."
Homer Simpson,Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Homer Simpson,"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
Lisa Simpson,Nothing.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, tell your father."
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom left today.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Lisa Simpson,He's gone. Forever.
Homer Simpson,And?
Lisa Simpson,I didn't think you'd understand.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
Homer Simpson,Me?
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
Homer Simpson,I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Lisa Simpson,Baboon!
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her."
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy."
Homer Simpson,Go Away.
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
Lisa Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,Nuts.
Homer Simpson,This isn't going well at all.
Lisa Simpson,"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
Homer Simpson,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,That was our wedding.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Children, it's time for you to go to bed."
Homer Simpson,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
Lisa Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
Lisa Simpson,You're so silly.
Homer Simpson,Gimme a banana.
Lisa Simpson,I don't have any banana.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Think nothing of it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Would you have to do extra work?
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, no."
Homer Simpson,"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
Bart Simpson,"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
Homer Simpson,Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homer Simpson,Uh oh.
Homer Simpson,"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
Homer Simpson,Mmm... hors doovers.
Marge Simpson,Homer! You promised!
Homer Simpson,I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
Lisa Simpson,"But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
Homer Simpson,"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
Marge Simpson,Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Homer Simpson,How do I look?
Marge Simpson,Do we have enough glasses?
Homer Simpson,Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Marge Simpson,Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Homer Simpson,What are all our friends names again?
Marge Simpson,Children! Go!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
Moe Szyslak,College boy.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
Homer Simpson,Why not? I paid for it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Homer Simpson,Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Marge Simpson,"Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,
Barney Gumble,"Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don't remember you being so beau --tiful."
Barney Gumble,Ow! Hey! Jeez!
Barney Gumble,Is that a new kind of Mace? It's really painful.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink."
Homer Simpson,It was me! You fell for it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary."
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Homer Simpson,Bart! Come over here.
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
Bart Simpson,Yes sir.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,That thing you know how to do.
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,Go to bed.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
Barney Gumble,"Oh, Homer, you're the king!"
Homer Simpson,"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
Husband Of Marge's Friend,"Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago."
Homer Simpson,You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Husband Of Marge's Friend,"Uh, gee Homer, don't quit..."
Homer Simpson,All right then.
Homer Simpson,Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Maude Flanders,Oh sure.
Homer Simpson,Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,
Barney Gumble,"Hey, thanks for invitin' me. I had a wonderful time."
Marge Simpson,I must apologize for my husband.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Remember, I said if."
Marge Simpson,I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Homer Simpson,Why? What'd you do?
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Marge Simpson,Come here!
Homer Simpson,Where-where are we going?
Marge Simpson,Shhh.
Marge Simpson,"I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
Bart Simpson,They're fighting in the car again.
Lisa Simpson,That music always sends a chill down my spine.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
Homer Simpson,The way I acted?
Homer Simpson,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Sophisticate #1,Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
Homer Simpson,I put it there.
Sophisticate #1,You did?
Homer Simpson,I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Sophisticate #1,Pure hilarity!
Sophisticate #2,Pure Homer!
Sophisticate #3,I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
Marge Simpson,I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
Homer Simpson,"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
Homer Simpson,About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
Bart Simpson,I understand why. You were wasted.
Homer Simpson,I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will."
Homer Simpson,Aw.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including ""Bible Bafflers"", ""Satan's Boners,"" ""Good Grief! More Satan's Boners"" and, for the teens, ""It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."""
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Reverend."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Sit down, Homer."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...
Marge Simpson,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,... or those just in need of a tune-up.
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
Homer Simpson,Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
Marge Simpson,We'll be there!
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
Bart Simpson,Now you wanna go?
Homer Simpson,They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Marge Simpson,We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that must be the babysitter."
Marge Simpson,Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Sultan,Simpson... Simpson...
Bart Simpson,"Come back for more, eh?"
Marge Simpson,Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
Homer Simpson,"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
Bart Simpson,What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Lisa Simpson,Mom! You wouldn't dare.
Bart Simpson,"Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand."
Homer Simpson,"No, you don't!"
Marge Simpson,Grampa?
Grampa Simpson,Huh... who?... what?
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, could you do something?"
Grampa Simpson,I can dress myself.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
Marge Simpson,"Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
Grampa Simpson,Just give me the list. I can read.
Marge Simpson,"All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves."
Marge Simpson,Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
Grampa Simpson,I heard that.
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do."
Grampa Simpson,Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, bait."
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, better get some gas."
Homer Simpson,Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
Worm Man,Where ya headed?
Homer Simpson,Catfish Lake.
Worm Man,"Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?"
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
Worm Man,He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.
Worm Man,... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, who says that?"
Worm Man,They do.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Worm Man,"Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though."
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
Bart Simpson,"After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
Bart Simpson,"Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!"
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen."
HELEN,Hel-lo Marge!
Ned Flanders,"Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
Homer Simpson,"None of your business, Flanders."
Homer Simpson,Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that."
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
Homer Simpson,I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. John... Gloria?"
Gloria,"My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny boy hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me."
John,"That's enough, Gloria!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?"
John,"She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies."
Gloria,"No, I'm not!"
John,Queen of the Harpies!
Gloria,"No, I'm not!"
John,"Here's your crown, your Majesty."
Gloria,"Get away from me, swine."
John,Queen of the Harpies!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes."
John,Your eyes? I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
Gloria,Let's never fight again.
John,We were fools to argue.
Gloria,Let's not talk about that.
John,Let's not talk at all.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?"
Ned Flanders,Well...
Maude Flanders,"Go on, Neddie."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Homer Simpson,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, why are you here?"
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?"
Homer Simpson,She's perfect.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Come on, Homer. What are her faults?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn."
Homer Simpson,I'm done.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Okay. Marge?
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Homer."
Marge Simpson,"He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
Homer Simpson,It's true. It's all true.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, don't interrupt."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Marge Simpson,"He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
Homer Simpson,I only did that a couple of times.
Lisa Simpson,Half a gallon of chocolate.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Lisa Simpson,Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Lisa Simpson,"Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
Bart Simpson,Check.
Grampa Simpson,Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
Lisa Simpson,"Grampa, what a question?"
Bart Simpson,"What's next, Lis?"
Lisa Simpson,Sprinkles and syrup.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it."
Grampa Simpson,"Well, all right, but put out that cigar."
Marge Simpson,"... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, we've missed the luau. What say we call it a night?"
Captain,"I don't want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book."
Grampa Simpson,"You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day."
Lisa Simpson,It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
Homer Simpson,"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?"
Homer Simpson,Would this be a good time to be honest?
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
Marge Simpson,Get back in bed.
Homer Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Marge Simpson,Sure.
Homer Simpson,Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
Marge Simpson,Homer?
Grampa Simpson,Sugar?
Lisa Simpson,Yes. Ten please.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Grampa, top me off."
Grampa Simpson,Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
Bart Simpson,"For the last time, yes!"
Homer Simpson,Good! Give up!
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square."
Otto Mann,"Tell my friends? All right, but I've got some pretty funky friends."
Convict,All right! I get out at noon and I'm already invited to a party.
Helen Lovejoy,"Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you."
Marge Simpson,Do I have to do this?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn't recommend it. Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I've ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It's all his fault, and I'm willing to put that in a certificate you can frame."
Grampa Simpson,Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
Grampa Simpson,That the Yanks are comin'...
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Holy mackerel!
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?"
Otto Mann,"Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?"
Bart Simpson,"Not yet, but the afternoon is young."
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, what's wrong?"
Lisa Simpson,Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
Bart Simpson,"You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh!"
Grampa Simpson,OW!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw haw!
Grampa Simpson,"You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?"
Nelson Muntz,Yeah.
Grampa Simpson,All right. I'll show you.
Nelson Muntz,Haw! Haw! Haw!
Grampa Simpson,Doggone it!
Grampa Simpson,"I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! I'm a feeb... a useless old... worn-out..."
Lisa Simpson,"It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
Bart Simpson,"Well, how do you make this feeling go away?"
Lisa Simpson,You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
Homer Simpson,I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Homer Simpson,"Uh, oh."
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Marge Simpson,"We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
Marge Simpson,To who?
Homer Simpson,To those weirdos in the worm store.
Marge Simpson,All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
Marge Simpson,"Oh yeah, sure."
Homer Simpson,Watch.
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
Marge Simpson,"Ohhh, Homer."
Homer Simpson,We're back!
Lisa Simpson,How's your marriage?
Homer Simpson,Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Grampa Simpson,"Pretending to cry. That's right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I'm crying, I'm so sad."
Lisa Simpson,"Way to go, Grampa."
Bart Simpson,I'll never trust another old person.
Grampa Simpson,I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
Worm Man,"Yup. General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day."
Customer,"And uh, no one's ever caught him?"
Worm Man,"Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell."
Lisa Simpson,"Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
Bart Simpson,What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa Simpson,"I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
Bart Simpson,"Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich."
Bart Simpson,I wonder how Richie died?
Lisa Simpson,"Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
Marge Simpson,"Kids, could you lighten up a little?"
Bart Simpson,"Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool."
Lisa Simpson,He's no wittier than the next superhero.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
Lisa Simpson,I stand corrected.
Marge Simpson,We're here!
Lisa Simpson,Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
Bart Simpson,This looks like a discount for...
Bart Simpson,Bartman!
Ticket Seller,Who are you supposed to be?
Bart Simpson,I'm Bartman!
Ticket Seller,Never heard of him. Full price.
Bart Simpson,Lousy rip off...
DIAMOND JOE,"Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I'd like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy."
DIAMOND JOE,Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. You might say I feel like Radiation Man!
Jimbo Jones,"That's Radioactive Man, jerk!"
DIAMOND JOE,"I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby."
Martin Prince,"Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?"
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Lost And Found Guy,"Let's see, we've got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid."
Otto Mann,"Hey, Bart-dude!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?"
Otto Mann,"My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!"
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Milhouse Van Houten,"C'mon, Bart. We're going to see Buddy Hodges."
Bart Simpson,The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Milhouse Van Houten,Yep.
Bart Simpson,"Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam."
Radioactive Man,Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
Fallout Boy,"Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies."
Radioactive Man,"Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen."
Radioactive Man,Look out!
Announcer,Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth?
Convention Director,"Well, wasn't that great?... Y'know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let's keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy ""Fallout Boy"" Hodges!"
BUDDY,Any questions?
Milhouse Van Houten,"When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too?"
BUDDY,"I am sure I don't know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of ""Cats"" -- anybody see it?"
Bart Simpson,"Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me."
BUDDY,"Yes, you, the masked boy."
Bart Simpson,Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
BUDDY,Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you little vultures leave him alone?
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It's the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl."
Dealer,Tell you what. I'll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep 'em there.
Dealer,Behold!
Bart Simpson,Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
Dealer,None other.
Bart Simpson,I bet it's worth a million bucks!
Dealer,"It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me."
Bart Simpson,All I got is thirty.
Dealer,Then you cannot have it.
Bart Simpson,"But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book."
Dealer,"Your emotion is out of place here, son."
Marge Simpson,"So, did you kids have fun?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes."
Marge Simpson,Ohhh.
Homer Simpson,I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
Bart Simpson,"All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!"
Homer Simpson,"All right, what are you getting at?"
Bart Simpson,I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Homer Simpson,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world."
Homer Simpson,"Well, t.s."
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
Marge Simpson,"Don't gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma..."
Young Patty,We'll give you half our allowance.
Young Selma,Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave.
Young Patty,This gives us a lot more free time.
Young Selma,Uh-huh. Let's take up smoking.
Marge Simpson,"For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
Older Patty,"Venus... Oh, Venus..."
Older Selma,We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Mrs. Glick,Here we are.
Marge Simpson,"But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
Marge Simpson,So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --"
Lisa Simpson,"She means you should get a job, stupid."
Bart Simpson,Me?
Adult Narrator,"Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever."
Homer Simpson,Bart! What are you staring at?
Bart Simpson,Uh... nothing.
Adult Narrator,"He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever..."
Homer Simpson,Bart! Stop it!
Bart Simpson,Sorry.
Bart Simpson,I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
Bart Simpson,Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Bart Simpson,"Hm... well, it's practically empty."
Bart Simpson,"Here you go, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?"
Bart Simpson,"No, not today. I need the dime."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade."
Bart Simpson,Ah-ha!
Bart Simpson,"Americanize this, my good man."
Teller,Okey dokey.
Bart Simpson,All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Teller,Let the good times roll.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek."
Lisa Simpson,"How's it going, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
Lisa Simpson,"Ah ha, now you look pathetic."
Bart Simpson,Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... ... Ah!
Bart Simpson,"Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up."
Barney Gumble,"Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this week."
Bart Simpson,Beat it.
Eddie,"Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?"
Bart Simpson,"Ugh, my dog ate it."
Lou,Gotta have a license to sell beer.
Bart Simpson,Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
Eddie,"We-ell, seeing as how it's a first offense..."
Lou,I guess we can overlook this.
Bart Simpson,"So long, officers. Uh-oh."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's all the --"
Homer Simpson,My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
Marge Simpson,The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
Mrs. Glick,"A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, ""Nazi Smasher""?"
Marge Simpson,I don't think so.
Mrs. Glick,"Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don't he?"
Bart Simpson,Mrs. Glick?
Mrs. Glick,"Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you've got a strong young back!"
Mrs. Glick,"Would you like something to eat? I've got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy."
Bart Simpson,"No, thanks. Who's that?"
Mrs. Glick,"Oh, that's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long."
Asa,"This one's for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to know..."
Mrs. Glick,"Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy."
Bart Simpson,"No, thanks."
Mrs. Glick,Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yes, ma'am!"
Bart Simpson,"Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am."
Mrs. Glick,"We'll start with a little light yard work. And when you're done, you can have a nice barley pop."
Mrs. Glick,I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?
Bart Simpson,All of 'em?
Mrs. Glick,Good boy.
Mrs. Glick,Now be careful with these. I'll be inside watching my stories.
Bart Simpson,Ow!. . .Ow!
Soap Actress,"Jack, please. I'm married."
Soap Actor,That must be what's turning me on.
Soap Actress,Oh... Stop it... some more.
Mrs. Glick,"Filthy, but genuinely arousing."
Bart Simpson,Finished.
Mrs. Glick,"Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! I'll get the iodine."
Mrs. Glick,"Now, don't fidget."
Bart Simpson,"Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!"
Mrs. Glick,They've never improved on iodine.
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Did you make any money?
Bart Simpson,"Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
Bart Simpson,There's a reason.
Mrs. Glick,"The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it?"
Bart Simpson,"I'll sludge you, you old bat."
Mrs. Glick,"Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?"
Bart Simpson,"Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?"
Mrs. Glick,"No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress."
Bart Simpson,"Great story, lady."
Bart Simpson,Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Bart Simpson,"No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!"
Mrs. Glick,"Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this."
Mrs. Glick,Two quarters.
Bart Simpson,Two quarters?
Mrs. Glick,"You deserve every penny. You know, I've told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too."
Bart Simpson,Two quarters!
Mrs. Glick,"Bart, you didn't say thank you."
Bart Simpson,"Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you."
Mrs. Glick,"You're welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies."
Bart Simpson,"Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her..."
Homer Simpson,"What's the problem, boy?"
Bart Simpson,"I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps."
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
Martin Prince,Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
Dealer,Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that?
Martin Prince,"It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!"
Dealer,No way. What do you want?
Bart Simpson,Can I have it for thirty-five?
Dealer,"No!... No!... Freakin' kids. I do not need this, I've got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns?"
Dealer,"Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't gettin' off the stool."
Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of ""Radioactive Man No. 1"" right now!"
Martin Prince,Wow!
Dealer,"Here you go. ""Muttonchop Yaz."""
Milhouse Van Houten,I don't want it.
Dealer,Freakin' kids!
Bart Simpson,"Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""Radioactive Man No. 1"". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
Dealer,Yes sir.
Bart Simpson,"Wow! Breathe it in, boys!"
Martin Prince,This is the stuff dreams are made of.
Milhouse Van Houten,It smells like my grandpa.
Bart Simpson,"Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home."
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
Dealer,Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
Radioactive Man,My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb!
Radioactive Man,Yaarrgh!
Radioactive Man,"I'm becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man."
Milhouse Van Houten,So that's how it happened!
Martin Prince,I would've thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.
Bart Simpson,Now you know better.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Turn the page, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like."
Milhouse Van Houten,Why can't we keep it at my house?
Bart Simpson,Your house? That's crazy talk!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours."
Martin Prince,"How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays."
Bart Simpson,Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wait a minute. What about Sunday?
Bart Simpson,Yeah. What about Sunday?
Martin Prince,"Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine."
Bart Simpson,Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wait a minute. What about zero?
Bart Simpson,Yeah! What about zero?
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah.
Martin Prince,"Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by ""Rock, Scissor, Paper"" competition. Best three out of five, how's that?"
Martin Prince,"Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I'll be taking my comic and..."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here."
Martin Prince,"If the comic book stays right here, then so do I."
Milhouse Van Houten,Me too!
Bart Simpson,"Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like."
Milhouse Van Houten,I want to read it again.
Bart Simpson,"Nice try, mister."
Martin Prince,"Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it."
Bart Simpson,"What do you mean, the last one alive?"
Martin Prince,I meant years from now.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, sure you did."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, don't push him!"
Bart Simpson,"I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson."
Marge Simpson,I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Thank you, Mrs. Simpson."
Bart Simpson,"Sweet dreams, boys."
Bart Simpson,One more step and you're a dead man.
Martin Prince,"I have to go to the bathroom, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, what's going on?"
Bart Simpson,Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Milhouse Van Houten,Let's tie him up!
Martin Prince,"Bart, is this how you treat all your guests?"
Bart Simpson,"Hmp, impressive."
Bart Simpson,"Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him."
Milhouse Van Houten,Okay. I'll go first.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, it is not going to happen, see?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"You're going crazy, Bart. I'm telling your mom!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers."
Martin Prince,I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom?
Milhouse Van Houten,You can't stop me.
Bart Simpson,The hell I can't!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Homer Simpson,They're fine.
Martin Prince,"Bart, the comic!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Don't let go of me Bart!
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit."
Milhouse Van Houten,"No, Bart! No!"
Martin Prince,"You know, if you guys hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak."
Bart Simpson,Shut up! Shut up!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Help me, Bart! I didn't even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns."
Marge Simpson,"Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
Martin Prince,"I'd raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could."
Homer Simpson,
Martin Prince,"It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came."
Bart Simpson,We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
Milhouse Van Houten,What's your point?
Bart Simpson,Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Radioactive Man,"Well, the world is safe again... but for how long?"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do."
Homer Simpson,"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns."
Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We've got to get a doctor!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman's terms it's quite simply a lack of blood.
Waylon Smithers,"Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion."
Waylon Smithers,How long does it take to sterilize a needle?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,A few seconds.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, skip it."
Waylon Smithers,Just leave me enough to get home.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I'm afraid it's not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It's quite rare.
Waylon Smithers,But I'm B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot."
Waylon Smithers,Go ahead.
Chimp,
Waylon Smithers,"Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death ... death's door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all."
Carl Carlson,"I'd give him my blood, except for one thing."
Lenny Leonard,What's that?
Carl Carlson,I don't wanna.
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
Carl Carlson,"You know, Homer, I am your supervisor."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sir."
Lisa Simpson,"Maggie, look. What's that?"
Lisa Simpson,Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
Marge Simpson,"What are you doing, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?"
Lisa Simpson,"It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap."
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
Marge Simpson,A-Positive.
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
Lisa Simpson,"You know his blood type, how romantic."
Marge Simpson,A mother knows everything about her family.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?"
Marge Simpson,Four B.
Bart Simpson,How many teeth do I have?
Marge Simpson,"Sixteen permanent, eight baby."
Homer Simpson,Earmuffs.
Marge Simpson,XL.
Lisa Simpson,Ring.
Marge Simpson,"I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
Bart Simpson,Allergies.
Marge Simpson,Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Bart Simpson,And?
Marge Simpson,Glow in the dark monster make-up.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
Marge Simpson,Bart does.
Homer Simpson,"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
Bart Simpson,Is it a Bible story?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
Bart Simpson,How did a lion get rich?
Homer Simpson,It was the olden days!
Bart Simpson,Oh.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
Otto Mann,"Just a sec, man!"
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?"
Otto Mann,"Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude."
Homer Simpson,Now let's get the show on the road.
Otto Mann,Okay. Let me wash up.
Waylon Smithers,"Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first."
Homer Simpson,Eh.... the boy.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,We're ready with the transfusion.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph."
C. Montgomery Burns,Charles... Montgomery... Burns.
Waylon Smithers,"Um, hmm."
C. Montgomery Burns,American Patriot
C. Montgomery Burns,... American Patriot.
C. Montgomery Burns,Master Of The Atom.
C. Montgomery Burns,Scourge Of The Despot.
C. Montgomery Burns,"""O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!"" Smithers, I'm back!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!"
Smitty,"Hi, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?"
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
Osvaldo,"Aye, caramba!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Heh-heh-heh! Well, that's game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!"
Waylon Smithers,"Just remarkable, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, Bart Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who?
Waylon Smithers,He's the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed."
Homer Simpson,"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
Homer Simpson,Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
Marge Simpson,The meaning of what?
Homer Simpson,"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
Homer Simpson,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
Homer Simpson,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!"
Homer Simpson,Bart!
Marge Simpson,We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
Homer Simpson,"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter."
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
Bart Simpson,You stink.
Homer Simpson,"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
Bart Simpson,An elephant's butt?
Homer Simpson,An elephant's butt.
Marge Simpson,But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Homer Simpson,Yup!
Marge Simpson,"You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?"
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, Marge!"
Marge Simpson,"Please, Homie? For me?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
Homer Simpson,Cheap son-of-a...
Marge Simpson,Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
Marge Simpson,Oh... thank you.
Homer Simpson,Where's the letter?
Homer Simpson,Where is it?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
Homer Simpson,"Bart, have you seen the letter?"
Bart Simpson,Yup.
Homer Simpson,"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
Bart Simpson,The last place I saw it...
Homer Simpson,Uh huh.
Bart Simpson,...was in my hand...
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Bart Simpson,...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?
Bart Simpson,"Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I..."
Homer Simpson,I'll show you mad in the morning.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself."
Homer Simpson,"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
Bart Simpson,"Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight."
Homer Simpson,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, I'm with you, Homer. Fight the power!"
Bart Simpson,"Why the hose, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
Homer Simpson,"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
Homer Simpson,"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, the mailman is here."
Homer Simpson,That's a good one. We'll use that.
Bart Simpson,"No, I mean the mailman's here."
Homer Simpson,
Mail Person,Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
Mail Person,That's right.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business."
Waylon Smithers,"He's written ""Like Hell I Can't!""... ""Up From The Muck""... and ""The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Roman,"All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired."
Postal Worker,"Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Homer Simpson,"Great plan, Bart."
Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results."""
Homer Simpson,Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
C. Montgomery Burns,Can I help you?
Bart Simpson,"They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?"
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"""...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..."" ""...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
Joey,"Homer, I don't tell you how to do your job. Okay?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Senile,"" eh? ""Buck-toothed,"" am I? ""Bony arms,"" are they? ""Liver spots,"" did I? ""Chinless,"" will you?"
Waylon Smithers,"His pink slip awaits your signature, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp."
Waylon Smithers,"But, sir --"
C. Montgomery Burns,But what?
Waylon Smithers,"Nothing, sir."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Me and my big... letter writing pen!
Marge Simpson,"Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you."
Waylon Smithers,You know Homer Simpson?
Joey,"Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him once in a while."
Waylon Smithers,"Hmmm huh. We uh, need him beaten up."
Joey,You got it.
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What is it?
Waylon Smithers,"Ah, nothing."
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What?
Waylon Smithers,"Beat, but don't kick."
Joey,Hold the kicks. Got it.
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What?
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, um, umm..."
Joey,"Hey, what did Homie do anyway?"
Waylon Smithers,He saved Mr. Burns' life!
C. Montgomery Burns,"In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah Smithers, how'd the beating go?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, uh... there was no beating."
C. Montgomery Burns,What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
Waylon Smithers,Because... I... I called it off.
C. Montgomery Burns,Judas!
Waylon Smithers,"I'm sorry, sir. But I just couldn't hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life."
C. Montgomery Burns,I see.
Waylon Smithers,"I know you're mad at me, but I think it's only fair to warn you, I'm going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober ""ying"" to my raging ""yang."" Put 'er there, old pal."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I'm, I'm afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed."
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.
Bart Simpson,"Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on, I'll check. Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?"
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick."
Moe Szyslak,What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer Simpson,"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems."
Barney Gumble,"Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooo, too practical."
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cutesy-poo.
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cornball.
C. Montgomery Burns,A pool table? Are you mad? I'm not gonna turn his home into a saloon.
C. Montgomery Burns,Eureka! We've found it!
Waylon Smithers,"B-but, sir... it's thirty-two thousand dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woe is me."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my! It's Mr. Burns."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad, he's smiling."
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, ""Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?"" And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here."
Bart Simpson,Wow! A crowbar!
Lisa Simpson,"It's to open the crate, stupid."
Homer Simpson,"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
Bart Simpson,Wow! A big ugly head!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
Bart Simpson,Awesome!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what does it do?"
Marge Simpson,It doesn't do anything.
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
Marge Simpson,"Whatever it does, it's doing it now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'll let you get acquainted with Se?Ÿ?ñor Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you see their faces, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, you're my god of generosity."
Homer Simpson,"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, ""A good deed is its own reward."""
Bart Simpson,"Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!"
Marge Simpson,"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
Marge Simpson,"Well... then I guess the moral is, ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
Lisa Simpson,Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Homer Simpson,Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Marge Simpson,But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Homer Simpson,Amen to that!
Lisa Simpson,"Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Lisa? It's six a.m. Something's wrong! Dad died!
Lisa Simpson,"No, no. He's fine."
Bart Simpson,"Well, what do you know? I'm relieved."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits."
Bart Simpson,"Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
Bart Simpson,Lisa did it.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
Bart Simpson,"Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, thank you."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry."
Bart Simpson,Can do.
Bart Simpson,Hm... Krusty hotline.
Krusty the Clown,"Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute."
Krusty the Clown,Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
Marge Simpson,Maggie!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!"
Bart Simpson,I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Homer Simpson,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
Marge Simpson,I washed it.
Homer Simpson,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
Marge Simpson,"Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
Marge Simpson,I don't know how this could have happened.
Bart Simpson,"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
Homer Simpson,You! You did this to me!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."

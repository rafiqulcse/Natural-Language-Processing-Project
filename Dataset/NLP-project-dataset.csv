 family mormon have never tried explain them they still stare puzzled from time time like some kind strange creature nonetheless they have come admire for the patience calmness equanimity acceptance and compassion have developed all the things buddhism teaches ,1
buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design ,1
seriously don say thing first all they won get its too complex explain normal people anyway and they are dogmatic then doesn matter what you say see mechante post and for any reason you decide later life move from buddhism and that doesn suit you identity though you still get keep all the wisdom then your family will treat you like you went through weird hippy phase for while there didncha and you never hear the end pro tip don put one these your wall jpg ,0
for your own benefit you may want read living buddha living christ thich nhat hanh you might find any subsequent discussions with your loved ones easier you are able articulate some the parallels that exist between buddhism and christianity don surprised they react negatively for having lost you treat them with compassion and deserved understanding although they may indeed display signs being hurt your new path properly sharing with them way that may alleviate their fear something they may perceive wrong the very least alien their beliefs may help allowing them the long run accept although not necessarily agree with your decision regardless where they end you have make your own way ,1
you should all sit down together and watch the simpsons episode where lisa becomes buddhist simpsons season episode she little faith then discuss ,0
 was teens when discovered zen meditation was then undiagnosed bpd being homeschooled and just gotten 56k modem with web connection where came across link zen meditation tried for couple weeks and the change was palpable felt the most profound sense peace ever felt grades immediately started going had more energy started martial arts just huge positive change all around parents asked something was wrong fundie parents when anything changes this was where naiveté kicked foolishly told them been trying meditation and really calmed down thought they happy that found something that helped but never forget what happened next mother affected this mockingly calm breathy voice she said you can pretend calm and happy all you want but without jesus you never content was that moment that any belief had christian faith all vanished completely realized that she had probably never been happy ever have never felt profoundly sorry for someone did for her that moment ,1
there are two varieties christians dogmatic that dwell words and conservative that take heart the spirit the teachings hate oversimplify things but helps this understanding you are discussing with dogmatic religious people who live the letter the law will uphill battle wish you luck you are discussing with moderates exchange idea should come fairly easily comparing contrasting also discussing parallel teachings presented differently wouldn out the ordinary they may give you relevant spiritual advice even though you are not believer their religion ,0
dont worry about trying explain yourself just meditate regularly and try hard you can more aware everything else will follow coming from someone who has been throught his situation welcome pms ,1
 recently told family that buddhist live the bible belt this whole ordeal involved leaving the baptist church and everything been pretty rough but those who really care about have been open and accepting they seen the good has created life and relationships with others fact there are handful christians who have lovely conversations with and that truly respect someone else suggested living buddha living christ great one read about the important dialogue between buddhists and christians also welcome you message ,1
 unto others you would have them unto you would good start ,1
first understand that you are not anyway control how they will react always find that any subject better understood first learning the vocabulary explain what the word buddha means most people believe buddhists praise worship and follow guy named buddha christians due jesus let them know that one could both buddhist and christian with conflict the teachings and the messages jesus are indeed buddhist philosophy jesus became enlightened buddha and realized that had become annointed being christ then continue with your practice and let them work out their own issues that advice all the best ,1
 recently heard similar question where person asked they should introduce meditation his loved ones who had challenges coping with problems life the answer from the lama was quite interesting instead giving people advice one should focus his practice that way others will see the change and maybe even ask about personally think better keep yourself even though you must really excited about you can also keep dharma books around the house and sure people will pick them for quick browse when you are not looking learn bit about other people traditions well browsing through books they owned ,1
different times different cultures same point they were trying get across jesus said god has beginning nor end buddha said mind was never born and has never died just replace the word meditation with prayer and couting the breath with the name jesus and everyone happy,1
does evil include the lady pai chunked ,0
our campaign has two suns one pelor the other shamedan pelor the god all know and find bit stifling really shamedan the sun desert the burning sun who will kill you without mercy even second though shamedan brings drought and brings the fire that destroys all you own generally not very nice has race fey called desert hags who worship him and have radiant and fire resistance but they haven played nearly much part the campaign they should have ,1
technically you could argue that sobek evil would represent power and also crocodiles whereas also represents fertile land also the guy could shapeshift into crocodile badass ,0
 always liked vecna the one time was able use him story had blast playing the fact that was far not the most powerful deity but was one the most dangerous due his portfolio but favorite pale night who technically not deity but close enough guess most the abyssal lords and the rulers the nine hells are fairly straightforward and have ample backstory but her lack thereof just intriguing ,1
though don have any good suggestions for additional deities the moment you should probably have some overlap the cavern dwelling gnolls might consider pelor the god evil blinding them with his wicked light loki has sufficiently fooled them over the years into thinking their benefactor always leading them the bountiful crops they steal from the peasantry they have statues him fat woman giving out food the starving they view the god death the god justice giving righteous end those gnolls that have served brutal conflicts point view can change everything ,0
 cliche but you can wrong with cyric mean was mortal who just nabbed all when got the chance you gotta respect that ,0
zon kuthon and his sister shelyn good deity have really cool story from the pathfinder setting plus off topic pathfinder has the coolest good deity ever cayden cailean was bard that got wasted one night stumbled into the temple the star stone artifact that can turn you into deity and woke the next morning with hangover memory the night before and godly powers ,1
 homebrew setting the primary lawful evil deity named for friend lewie essentially has three domains tyranny law applied without mercy vengeance and community the idea being that cruel and harsh god but also recognizes that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar thus his church often the most benevolent toward the common people day day basis the running gag that lewian churches sponsor more inner city basketball teams than any other major faith you probably want change the name but might make interesting dynamic within your setting ,0
for one campaign pretty much just snatched the chaos god nurgle lord plague from the whfb wh40k universe renamed him narghull was nar ghull can remember random apostrophes are always nice though the campaign revolved around his cult trying wake the god from sleep that had lasted 1000 years but sadly stalled very lazy this was back was never meant encountered directly meaning never worked out any stats anything basically works spread plague and other diseases and pretty damn evil think ,0

 like the idea prometheus giving magic the pcs however think that prometheus should more like demi god and that the reason why gives the magic mortals prometheus could jealous the fact that the gods have all the powers and they granted him only half status upon his creation thus his revenge giving humanity order turn the tides power among deities and mortals furthermore perhaps the repercussion prometheus feels from his action being dragged the underworld cerberus making him seem less than deity like and more mortal inhuman order face judgment from egyptian goddess morals virtue and judge the dead ,1
pelor the burning hate also hextor boss god tyranny and conquest always fun think one the books there god lawyers too ,0

zen master bassui said when the functioning analytical consciousness destroyed feelings are purified this referred the pure land the west you truly want know the meaning being born the pure land you must first know the master who born this land the physical body has never from its inception been the true body but rather temporary formation the five aggregates after the four elements disperse what remains called the self the self originally empty what that born the pure land there master born the pure land what that seeks this land bliss just extinguish the ever seeking mind rid thoughts and attachment form and the body consisting the four elements will have individual self when there individual mind the nature mind and there aspect disorder ,1
pure land other power opposed the usual self power taught most buddhist schools though the pure land here and now and not some other dimension the afterlife ,1
there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,1
 going try comment this simply can gets metaphysical and some may even say supernatural but hope you can try maintain open mind enough for help with your understanding everything that physical everything that exists the universe and beyond are created the power the mind exercised through consciousness mara created the samsara worlds planes dimensions that may experience joy sadness love heartbreaks etc this was done through his her its focus the mind and streams consciousness began attracted these worlds planes dimensions and begin develop craving for existence and thus begins the cycle rebirth the pure lands buddhism were created the focus the mind amitabha buddha way help individuals attain enlightenment their own pace amitabha buddha understood that the attraction emotions sex love and existence can overwhelming for normal individuals overcome within one lifetime 100 years average for human beings other beings much shorter and yet others much longer created the pure lands the west place refuge and practice for those who call upon his name sincerely this place not metaphorical state mind while these individuals are earth for lack better word real though not necessarily physical the way feel physical things via the electromagnetic repelling force electrons this world certain laws physics are applicable that world land plane dimension whatchamacallit certain laws physics not apply and yet newer laws superphysics would also the rule there that not the law our world now having been carried this land doesn mean that the individuals are guaranteed enlightenment first they still need cultivate themselves while there enlightenment not given dependant every single individual consciousness efforts shed the fetters samsara anger ignorance and jealousy and embrace the noble truths they may choose rejoin the samsaric worlds again and back into the cycle rebirth but least they have the option stay and cultivate themselves the pure land the west that would the main difference between the abrahamic idea heaven against the amitabha buddha pure lands the west hope this helps ,1
 think your characterization pure land isn that far off there reason not that popular among westerners odd abandon christianity judaism and take pure land because first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma but now seems much leap faith the abrahamic religions least the pure land sect most forms buddhism have some sort supernatural element some orthodox believers might deny that just like some christians might attempt make scientific arguments for the world being 6000 years old the very least you have rebirth and different planes that includes devas zen seems have the least reverence for dogma which why popular the west the other western strategy assume things are meaningful figuratively and not literally but yeah buddhism religion the end the day for most its followers ,1
most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1
you won find one answer your question but the pure land state mind perspective reality not separate place let quote thich nhat hanh human beings our deepest desire find environment which secure and where there love and understanding all want live such environment you live surroundings where you feel there security understanding and love and where people have the capacity transform their suffering fear and attachment then you live the pure land from finding our true home this isn leap faith all because you have already been the pure land but momentarily every time you bring the buddha mind fully then you are said the pure land imagine because you enter that state some degree this not matter faith but expanding upon what you know joyful experience quite different the abrahamic religions concept heaven which eschatological reality rather than gnostic one will add that there course are some who believe the pure land totally separate paradise however there are positive ways understanding this when the state mind another rebirth will seem like such foreign reality that may well different place entirely ,1
 first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma isn good thing about buddhism least for outsider that much easier pick and choose what parts you not want use see dogma kind environment habitat for the profound and useful ideas develop all religions have something useful buddhist religions and not just one homogeneous buddhism just seem have something that more relevant and powerful the context our culture ,1
from limited knowledge the pure land not paradise but place contemplation stepping off point where you are given the knowledge leave the cycle suffering and rebirth anything more akin the now defunct catholic idea purgatory than actual heaven ,1
 response your question about how amitabha created the pure land this quote from the article pure land buddhism wikipedia the longer sukhāvatīvyūha sūtra the buddha begins describing his attendant ānanda past life the buddha amitābha states that past life amitābha was once king who renounced his kingdom and became bodhisattva monk named dharmākara dharma storehouse under the guidance the buddha lokeśvararāja world sovereign king innumerable buddha lands throughout the ten directions were revealed him after meditating for five eons bodhisattva then made great series vows save all sentient beings and through his great merit created the realm sukhāvatī ultimate bliss this land sukhāvatī would later come known the pure land chinese translation important remember that buddhism has been around for thousands years and that for long time buddhists didn have telescopes big machines scan the brain with his holiness the dalai lama himself has said that the discoveries science and the teachings buddhism contradict then the discoveries science are correct this video tgv1gwvrz one the major teachings the buddha was test out each his teachings oneself order see they were true rather than taking his word faith without proof however course just man who has seen mountain some remote region where one has not traveled may believed until the distance that region crossed might have some sort faith buddhist teachings since the people doing the teachings have often devoted their whole lives the teachings the buddha ,1

the discussion about the rat ended concluding won work because you will naturally headbutt the rat death minotaur might work with another race though trog wrath very very very difficult survive you have boots levitation and lots food you might able hover over lava deep water won help summons giant sized creatures other than that tomb card might work you have your stash food not sure you not using shield you might well switch two handed axe from experience anti magic isn that great with brand fire you can generally kill things faster use holy versus liches and other undead casters and also kill them faster ,1
 could swear they lowered trog wrath just got extremely lucky because recently tried make the switch kobe and was not difficult all just took food ring and some perma food and carved out two space area near the the summons were actually not the worst part the worst got was berserk hill giant and the vast majority were just berserk bears for the worst part was actually the rotting since happened least times and never caught right away while spamming rest,0
for the love gods don the abyss until trog wrath over none your teleport blink panic buttons work lost handful very promising mibes this way ,1
 when and how supposed swap tso and branch order from there basically you switch immediately before entering crypt clear crypt max tso piety then holy brand your best weapon your case that executioners axe and off you post endgame branch order like whatever theres strict order like there the early game whichever branch you feel best prepared for how avoid meeting terrible fate the hands trog wrath you have book with blink soon you leave trog train transloc little bit that you can cast then whenever surrounds you with berserking enemies you can blink out the middle them and run staircase teleport you can keep scrolls blinking hand for this purpose but feel more secure also having the spell trog wrath includes fire miscasts that burn all your shit see trick with going lair and having rat block you off but this still viable you can the rat shield thing with most combos but its tedious and unnecessary and your case the minotaur retaliatory headbutt would kill the rat anyway its not option antimagic axe that carry around viable for use all since strictly one handed should train shields use with since have shield reflection could use not really war axes arent very good and while has fantastic selection resists does little damage that its not practical choice weapon against any tough monster wouldnt forgo the damage output weapon use physical shield shields arent very good for melee allruners and therse always tsos divine shield ability you want reflection isnt good shield brand plus its double not good for tso worshiper you reflect poison projectile and hits something you will incur penance for use poison ,1
 brother trog very wrathful indeed but his will destroy you neither endless nor inevitable going take the route many will find the easy way out and say that getting past trog your level trivial his wrath dangerous out the open but when you are able choose the area diluted mere timesink what you must grab your closest disintegration wand and cut two diagnols into the wall this will allow you only view one other tile time this point you simply need make sure you have good chunks permafood pip two and then either drop your scrolls wear conservation that point you just spam rest and then tab every time trog has tantrum minotaur your power should have trouble killing his summons after long while you will get message saying has calmed down then you are free worship that damned tso trog wrath your level probably one the least dangerous things you can spend your time dealing with you are willing cheese ,1
 were you slime zot except for the orb chamber and blade hopefully you find some better armour you really want good executioner axe before you convert well the okay but could better you really need wearing plate gda something heavier you have more than abandoned trog with level mibe and found pretty trivial the berserked stone giants weren terribly difficult and cleared tomb and most all hells while under trog wrath but somewhat wary trying this with your low and weak weapon you could try waiting out but takes thousands and thousands turns very boring one handed axes suck use executioner axe ,1
 have currently rune mibe right now and abandoned trog then immediately cleared crypt max piety and enchant executioner axe then threw caution the winds and cleared pan and hells while under trog wrath was tricky but doable make sure you have curing potions that time was strong enough take out trog summons all sides problem worked but could have died with worse luck ,1
 your stage you should strong enough take the berserk summons have the resources escape out them retreat corridor and take them one one quaff curing heal rot would also recommend you get plate armour better asap for the and guaranteed damage reduction also wield the biggest axes you can find kill things faster ,1
 you max armour dodging and shields for tso divine shield then the berserkers are joke can wipe them even when fully surrounded and only lose health even with armour and dodging they won give you much trouble ,0
ewwww why are you using broad axe get real weapon bet trog gave you good battleaxe exec axe something splint get plate armour better trog wrath will completely destroy char with such poor defenses ,1

 course yes sir you are right should vote the current government back into power because they clearly more than one man ,1
nonsense who claimed that the panacea for all evils will turn india into supapowaaa 2015 find one poster who claimed such here almost everyone acknowledges that the best atleast one the best amongst the current available lot and can provide governance that will atleast better relative the current upa regime ,1
yes won solve all the problems overnight but strong leader with plan still better than idiots with plan case study obama people expected the economy fixed the thursday after was elected and course that didn happen still fairly shit and most the issues that were big deal 2009 are still pertaining but still did manage eliminated subsidies private lender middlemen student loans and protect student borrowers healthcare reforms for tens millions americans expanded hate crime law the include sexual orientation appointed nations first chief technology officer signed financial reform law establishing consumer financial protection bureau signed financial reform law prohibiting banks from engaging proprietary trading are these irrelevant and pointless they aren hasn lifted america out the sewer but empowered students women consumers medical patients etc that they can achieve their potential without shit like insurance and loans get their way thus bringing back point the change you wantt see etc etc and that what believe modi can the change for the country must come from the grass roots easier said than done not like have deal with lapse enforement laws corruption red tape logistics etc you can call modi bots but think the alternatives double failure mms rahul gandhi digvijay chiddu what has the congress done besides spoonfeed the backward zombies and keep them backward ,0
please change the title wretched country where its news sold appease the ruling party wretched country where terrorism sickularism maoism separatism tolerated wretched country whose leaders appease community the name religion and caste wretched country where its leaders are involved corruption scams rape money laundering tax evasion etc not saying namo will solve all problems but atleast will not remain mute and deaf like manmohan singh who does not even give interviews about his governance atleast namo speaks good bad about his state manmohan singh does not not even speak about the country just lapdog sonia gandhi ,1
and even more wretched the country that can depend even one man there have been people throughout history who were pivotal figures gandhi and lincoln are two examples have seen modi handle his charge that gujarat superbly contrast have seen politicians who are inept and corrupt led the congress which can sell out the country for example pitting against cbi and having suggestions surface that pakistan sponsored attack admitted pakistan was inside job yes bank the man hope nothing happens him because our opinion party that capable compromising india interests vis vis pakistan capable killing someone well ,1

amartya sen says “ indian citizen don’ want modi has not done enough make minorities feel safe ” said being asked why did not want sen said “ could have first all been more secular and could have made the minority community feel more secure ” indian demographics are not uniformly distributed muslim and the rest hindu all over the country there are cities and towns where muslims and christians are majority very large minority yet come across even single town that integrated that where the two communities live together there are hindus who live muslim and christian majority townships who are very much minorities and they are not faring well all just sad and bewildering that economists the stature sen can not see the plight hindu minorities hindu majority country the word secular has been reduced slogan that now means being overly solicitous obscurantist elements the muslim leadership while ignoring the plight all other minorities the traditional sense the word what non secular thing has modi done has introduced madrassas hindu schooling has made some religious rules conduct for women forcing muslims wear some marker distinguish them from the rest the people has gone and interfered with the running their institutions had sen spent more time india would have known the answers these questions and also why secularism has become such hated word the majority indians don’ want situation where the minority feel insecure and could legitimately think that there was organised violence against them 2002 think that terrible record and don’ think indian prime minister indian citizen who has that kind record not narsimha rao was the home minister during the 1984 delhi riots which are better example state sponsored riots than any other indian history when least 3000 sikhs were murdered mob violence delhi alone home minister rao was directly responsible for ordering the delhi police delhi was union territory then stand aside the sikhs were murdered their neighborhoods when rao was elevated being the sen kept his counsel not bring the sikh riots justify the godhra riots but only point out the hypocrisy people using all their lungs scream about gujarat but are silent about all other incidents violence modi could have made the majority community feel that they are not maltreating the minority and going against the long indian tradition being tolerant indians have been tolerant things for far too long are tolerant sewage our drinking water poison our food rape our streets loot our leaders war and murder our neighbors have lost half our country and have been ethnically cleansed wherever are not majority are tired being tolerant and most all are tired interminable lectures well meaning academics how should run our affairs and what can and can not think please sen let ,1
few questions for sen you even have voter card how many days you spend india year you use government services and have deal with our babus you have haggle every day with subzi vali save few can and people are fed with years congress rule modi may not saint but thousand times better than the alternative ,1

 coming out strongly against gujarat chief minister narendra modi nobel laureate amartya sen monday said does not want him become india’ prime minister does not have secular credentials ironic that economist thinks secularism more important than roti kapda makaan bijli and paani and that assuming that modi somehow unsecular ,1
all those flipping over comments made let clear all that phony mannerism doesn work all gave chance economist mms who fucking devalued everything about india can take that chance anymore his amartya sen views are used manufacture consent media among people ,0

 don really think means just talking out his ass that what politics all about every one talks shit and hopes the people fall for and make them power not feel that has the best interest the nation heart action speaks louder than words ,1
 can remember when was the last time there was that much anticipation political rally huge crowd over lakh people stadium and every other one was was glued watch live telecast and didn disappoint never heard any speeches for more than say min but today watched the full 1hr speech and man imo was better than atal bihari first begins the speech with min telgu rhetoric which quite unique then doesn hesitate raise controversial issue and put things boldly like his support telangna pakistan issue vote bank politics food security chinese intrusion and targeted every congress nutjobs overall was well rounded attack and khangress for sure have hard time putup something even remotely defendable ,1
looking the video makes realize how disconnected from indian politics they are having dance performance and song recitals people sit through that anyone who has been political rally could you elaborate the experience also you think rahmans vande mataram song was pirated they need take special permission for that ,1
dammit good and got good speechwriters let see the potential headlines tomorrow vhp miffed modi atheist people angry that modi offended their religion congress says trick modi modi still communal neighbour plant died modi responsible the last one may not true ,1
 country first woah there thought nazism actually taught something ,1
textbook definition fascism thanks for clearing that one last thing ,1
looking modi from outside seems similar popularity what obama was here when was running for elections both seem different from rest the field both attract huge number followers ideas both are fresh and both give people their countries hope that previous politicians had all but removed obama good president opinion but isnt good was saying will and that probably because political restraints under expect the same happen with modi seems have done lot good for gujarat but not sure can that level good for entire india both obama and modi are very eloquent orators ,1
 really have high hopes this man have never seen public demanding man made ,1
 jizzed hard just reading ,0
 big fan either modi bjp but what says here what would want politicians say more often rather than saying things like any person gets angry after seeing injustice meted out family affected this then cannot held guilty bihar beti etc attempt appease any particular religion infuriates extent that people are ready castigate modi for innocuous somewhat misguided puppy analogy and then don acknowledge him when makes sense this the thing about really polarizing india people either love him immensely despise him completely very few people the middle ,1

what are the objections this article obviously written someone who wary modi and that modi fans not like this but yet see comment that challenging this article facts but from point view hate the congress hate and dread the rss this article picks out the salient points the article speaks laudatory terms about his record development and his rockstar appeal compared the soporific near whispers octogenarians like mms the same time also rightly critical his and his base virulently anti non hindu record and yes modi hasn been cleared the aspx 286929 ,0
too late this party but this article prime example opinion pieces masquerading news now people who happen agree with the opinion think its factual but the article evaluated with open mind anything but factual narendra modi one the most divisive politicians india’ history hmm has the journalist done survey can quote something said modi that divides people along religious lines not coincidentally mass rioting broke out last week uttar pradesh india’ most populous and politically important state after legislator from modi’ party circulated fake video two hindus being lynched muslim mob this complete speculation and ignores the sexual harassment hindu girls the lynching two hindu boys the harassment the families the murdered boys and most importantly the massacre hindus joly village india may the world’ most populous democracy but election campaigns here are often fueled hate and soaked blood violence elections has come down drastically since sheshan days back the early nineties what world this guy living choosing modi fiery orator who once peppered his speeches with anti muslim slurs please provide examples where modi has said anything against religion community none can found modi has shifted his focus recently development and now the darling india’ business elite modi focus development has been there since before the 2007 elections this not recent emphasis all all its opinion piece ,1

nothing more amusing than using image from the media jpg article titled images media will never show you for those who don read telugu that second picture from newspaper reporting modi rally hyderabad ,1
 remember dad taking one such rally speaker was rajiv gandhi remember correctly this perhaps the late 1980s dad had zero interest politics had served nearly three decades indian army and that way had some respect for the ministers etc suppose had never ever seen crowd that big ever remember sitting dad shoulders looking over the boundary wall college where happened study decades later here the location where took place the oval ground bottom right where they usually land the chopper and the crowd was addressed the large triangular area the left that land has slight slope the north dad and were standing the road the left the picture couldn see ranjiv gandhi could get idea where the stage was and that about also remember uncle who was into congress party being very busy canvassing and transporting people the rally tldr political rallys have always been huge even kerala even back the 80s that just how parties work ,1
modi the leader the indian neo nazi party bjp most the people who support him are skinheads who call for extermination muslims resorts appeasement neo nazis for more info about fuhrer here documentary about the modern day hitler modi and his policies c0zvadtrdpm also the ministers under him have been sentenced for inciting the riots like this woman and this guy ,1
 modi divisive figure people like call him you will get strong opinions from both sides and zero facts the same time the principle political opponent the nehru gandhi family with strong dynasty influence inc unifying figure where there global agreement that they are themselves highly corrupt and shelter the corrupt and the sole purpose they serve that indian national congress party would disintegrate the absence sycophancy some people strongly believe that having dumbass with zero track record experience governance much more preferable compared someone who may may not been responsible for sheltering the rioters each their own ,1
tell many people you can vote for modi this govt has destroyed the country economy there development there law and order most important all not able protect the country from muslim jihadis who are trying kill many possible ,1
lets say modi has attributes abcxyz people who like him like him for abcx people who don like him and despise him lot for cxyz that people who like him like him for different reasons than the reasons for which people hate him this why the whole confusion and cacophony opinions when person who trying understand the landscape modi has huge popularity among nris and india which don really understand why his abc characteristics for which liked much his supporters are his economic and growth policies and his pro hindutva ala pat robertson bill reilly style christian conservatism political stance his xyz characteristics for which hated much his opponents his association with gujarat riots during 2002 his state suffered through terrible riots between hindus and muslims triggered train full hindu pilgrims allegedly burned muslim mob resulted state wide backlash against muslims and about 1000 muslims died and many many more were displaced india has had his own share riots and usually the ruling leaders aren blamed much but narendra modi hated much because came television and sympathized with the hindu rioters addition there were reports him letting happen despite the controversy over the years modi has enjoyed widespread support his state and won many elections terms personality wise outspoken and has all the leaderish not leadership qualities indians desire their leader this year election could quite like 2012 american election where lot more people voted against mitt romney and republicans rather than voted for obama although congress government isn popular bjp runs with polarizing figure like modi then there will people flocking congress government but this does not predict the outcome the election hope that helps ,1
 been following reddit for while mainly because how entertaining and sometimes informative the comments various issues are been thinking joining for while and bit the bullet after seeing this thread what has modi done candidate what the gujarat story his many enemies will typically quote various statistics show his state poor light but the problem with statistics they can quoted out context reach the conclusion you want according your agenda gujarat means the most developed state india and does indeed lag behind many social indicators but the fact was doing far worse most these child malnutrition before modi became and speaking indicators rarely will your see article highlighting that gujarat contributes percent india industrial output and percent its exports gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate for indian state and accounts for percent new job creation gujarat has 100 percent rural electrification with power supply over 000 villages which has been boon not only for small scale industries but also farmers gujarat has agricultural sector growth percent against the national average percent gujarat known for great road network connecting the above 000 villages well well managed public transportation system gujarat known for relatively low corruption levels and higher efficiency police and government this has been helped governance and policing initiatives general getting things done much faster gujarat than the average for indian governments tata got its nano plant approved matter days rather than months years complaints about roads infrastructure etc are generally dealt with quickly there more but this should for start and typing out this much gleaned from various online and gujarati sources some reddit itself afraid already established myself moditard and will probably the immediate target all manner criticism ,1
truth told there not insignificant percentage the middle class who are willing vote for modi order avoid voting for congress corruption rahul gandhi but the modi tards are not making this easy decision should ,1
modi very divisive leader you want listen the secular sickular people the country thought they forgot how spell are dyslexic they have misspelled the word divisive what they actually mean decisive and that exactly the kind leader need all the media cbi bureaucrats doesn want this change they have gotten used the lollipops they are handed out and know modi comes they will get reprimanded and get grounded politicians fear they might also get some good good old school spanking too for their past deeds and spanking mean going jail legal implications ,1
the fact that nri are the second biggest group usa shows the failure this govt all toppers the country are preparing leave have left already they are fed this govt policies own college friends have left india they have desire come back ,1
shortest answer that the ruling party the left side the political spectrum and has gone over the top appeasing poor people different religions and distributing free stuff modi leans the right and more free market kind guy and believes more the western sense secularism and wants uniform civil code one big blot his career which the opposition milking like desparados the 2002 riot during which happened the gujarat that another variable the equation ,1
 you come the wrong place ask about modi this place full ultra right wing hindu neonazis asking here about modi like asking westboro baptist church about religious tolerance you should probably read about him online from independent media sources ,1

 was pro congress long time ago long time before joined reddit and now completely pro bjp stance has grown even stronger after all the discussion here itt people who are ignorant about politics and dislike inspite the fact that their future and future india depends one piece advise for all those who show apathy towards politics either get interested now you would end choosing the wrong ones who keep screwing you and the country also you are least interested note this point well state elections you can vote for regional parties but never vote for regional parties loksabha elections for 2014 you have just options bjp congress you still have time make your mind for either them all those expecting third front dont please dont they would turn out larger looters than the congress such government ever forms for all the aap supporters you can vote for them delhi you wish and its your right vote for whoever you wish but loksabha elections dont vote for aap already existence plenty regional parties making mess parliamentary decision making dont make worse ,0

 flick the switch towards modi thank the high decibel campaign the congress and stooges letting know all the things that modi did not sure which side the congress the media they seem campaign for modi and reminds cho ramaswamy could someone else too comment about the dmk loss the last election they gave out freebies like free and discounted cable connections lots people that very same thing boomeranged against the dmk showing the dmk corruption scam and other money grubbing activities the dmk larger audience with the free tvs and cable connections done the very tools that they were using bribe voters self goal ,1
not india such but conversations with north east friends who tell about the horrors congress rule refugees appeasement and that didn sit down well with regarding bjp was pro bjp during vajapayee but 2003 obviously helped shake that confidence only after years kind figured that there deeper game play looking the amount propoganda newspapers went voice their hate against modi wasn just right and yeah sickularism have had talk with folks who have problem with modi and they are entitled their opinion some the information they have which they use build their opinion selective and flawed but then some the information know might well flawed too everything war now are age information warfare more the information more tough shove away the and know the truth the human mind can only take much ,0
" before used anti rss result anti bjp very skeptical towards aap thought jlp bill was silly drama used lean lot towards left but was not impressed their presence national stage thought other 3rd front parties are over ambitious clowns supported congress they appeared the best available option they are definitely not perfect but better than other options however must admit like most their purported aam admi initiatives you know the which will feed lazy people now still dislike rss vhp their ideology bjp fan boys their rabid bigotry scares don think modi evil too but very skeptical that would able control his masters fans sangha parviar cronies aap not bad very impressed how transparent they have kept their finances for that reason alone wish they will win elections delhi nothing has changed about left other 3rd front but then again you barely hear about them online anyway things seem would still with inc the best available option for the lok sabha

 from gujarat have seen the transformation with own eyes give you example when started college ahmedabad 2004 the moment step out from the kalupur railway station eyes used burn due pollution the simple solution that converting petrol autos cng autos modi implemented that policy converting all petrol autos cng autos gave them deadline and incentive and assistance from the govt make that transition the time was 2006 could really see the difference harassment veteran auto wallahs nothing just plain education and assistance which resulted prompt compliance the riverfront wow explanation required guess rurally the roads that connected remote villages have drastically improved and has the journey time and the journey itself have lived entire life gujarat and have seen and felt the transformation also the internet and electricity claims that modi bjp make are true native place remote village northern gujarat and have seen that improvement facilities good metro grandparents place has grand plans and implements them well even the much lauded gujarat tourism true and not hoax have heard several praises from elder tourists from southern india who have opted for the gujarat tourism trips there can many more examples but long story short knows how make the best from the available resources and has definitely changed and improved gujarat ,1

 tell people from gujarat people who been there what gujarat like just like any other good state india good urban centres and average poor rural areas are there broken roads there yes you people get clean drinking water and other facilities yes and people have access drinking water their premises according planning commission data 2011 clean drinking water treated drinking water like anywhere india completely like the usa terms infrastructure and civic amenities lol there still miles before you even remotely touch that level ,1
 been ahmedabad gandhinagar sometime 2005 and the roads there are high quality and they must the usual counter call this that capital city they take more care roads are automatically renewed etc live hyderabad and proof otherwise also like madhu kishwar wrote her manushi blog people have peaceful and safe social outing even after 10pm etc which relatively unthinkable hyderabad the cops themselves might give people washing and send home ,1
not much they would like you believe but still one the best states india live there are broken roads there still poverty lack clean drinking water issue the people are really friendly and nice fun state and the prohibition alcohol has done wonders the civic life have been gujarat for over years now and have loved every moment except for the fact that isn very accommodating meat lovers come and visit the state sometime the gir national park rann kutch especially during the rannmahotsav daman and diu somnath and many other places visit ,1

from someone who has been gujarat while travelling various places some years back still remember the clean lane highways windmills everywhere the both sides the roads and the scenic beauty top that development total coherence with nature preservation was just small naive boy then though your dismay and mine those windmills and solar cell arrays are still hold rajasthan iirc the state things hopeless with the increasing thefts inox wind 150 crore the authorities don give fuck except looking for their cut and the private companies say they can install the machinery with these thefts going and its 2013 now compare that with gujarat also someone can confirm have heard from friends that any govt official doesn see your queries complaints within specific period time you can directly approach the modi its that simple try contacting mayawati ,1
yes has used live vastrapur which was considered lower middle class middle class area the vastrapur lake was developed front eyes changing the entire socio economic fabric that place within years also the will second rbecks visited friends village very small blink and you miss place near himmatnagar and the roads were lanes speaking people the village they told because the roads they could get their produce the cities themselves instead hiring 3rd party transporters have stayed many cities over life time delhi mumbai bangalore gujarat and comparing them all over one life time the changes are surprisingly drastic and saying that development happening all over india does not cut majority this development happening urban areas only but gujarat you can see happening both urban and rural areas,1
the clearly sarcastic and malignant posting this obviously very modest and holier than thou aap supporter ,1
 not all there reason why modi known feku popularly everywhere now doubt has done some good work gujarat but that only from more marketing perspective rather then any good value the people kankariya lake ahemdabad very well known face changed now completely looks like any international location but now common man cant there why because entry fee kankaria lake inr know inr not big deal but once lake which was open public now costing inr just enter highways and roads connecting village best but roads villages and cities are having tons holes industrialization has gone crazy there regulation come from kutch and have seen things really mad there terms pollution there proper guideline implemented terms what should height chimney mills chimney mills are low that when you even walk your home your feet will get black pollution villages are unbearable villages still runs most public transport not petrol diesel but fucking kerosene education definitely improving but you wont see much difference compared years consumption tobacco would highest gujarat gujarat govt corrupt like any other state govt company was bidding for project gujarat were told pay lacs for tender and tender will your favour but still cant give guarantee tomorrow someone else comes with better amount will ditch you your face narmada damn very good example modi doing good work really great work its benefits are tremendous but the way modi portraying progress gujarat just cream but ground reality worst then you can imagine ,1

well the guys below the original active participation politics started with development agenda modi and iac movement regarding this anti corruption middle class etc this aap party not the first india happened earlier during jayaprakash narayan era and his chela mulayam singh was arvind kejriwal that time the second time happened during singh era its simply matter time and enjoy how history repeats ,1
the very fact that the delhi elections are discussed india far more often than the elections the other states indicates that aap having great impact democracy india were not for aap vast majority would not care about these elections the major political parties india have always been cahoots and indian elections have had almost impact the lives most its citizens regardless how many seats aap wins hope all realize that this the first time grassroots organization built volunteers and without any kind corporate backing can have great impact indian elections ,1

what were the other policies you discussed not asking for details you gave above just bullet points thx ,0
 thought would not understand policy discussions but what you have listed simple good way summarize increase oil production guess that should easy since saw recently that leaders all parties unanimously support this initiative for nominal amount really need this for inclusive development but guess this would need the support state governments too have really retarded regional parties ruling promising states congress has totally failed this aspect hope bjp could turn things around definitely agree especially are way behind electronics market many semiconductor companies have huge non manufacturing sites here iirc intel was supposed usher semiconductor manufacturing early 2005 and they pulled out because these lethargic policy makers not beat dead horse but wish bjp and all parties become serious tackling the silent corruption government especially the regulatory and enforcement boards like law and order environment water totally screwed one family members high ranking official one such board doesn matter which government has been transferred incessantly recently got transferred when got into tussle with opposition party mla industry and the ruling party minister summoned him next week and handed the transfer and top all not even honest does the least that could and that follows court orders god bless the honest officers hope this would change maybe the political discourse that happening among people nowadays will change ,1
nice know that thank you ,1
its because bjp wants such rules place and its better get done under congress they won get blamed that way ,1
" india has been ruined congress and populist schemes the problem with populist schemes that you can make noise you are opposition you instantly branded anti poor another problems once introduced not easy get rid them aap with share leftists and socialist like prashant bhushan yogendra yadav binayak sen etc are more towards congress ideology with added agenda anti corruption compared bjp want see some pro market reforms which will create jobs and get our country
back growth rate another problem have the minority appeasement meeting tauqueer raza and then going defend him aap doing the same things
that congress did third holier than thou attitude they just don accept that there are good non corrupt people all parties lot people from
congress and bjp joined aap and suddenly became non corrupt while they were corrupt their old parties don hate aap don like their ideology and attitude would even vote there was option aap like party with right leaning
economic ideology afaik loksatta one such party but even though stay hyd don have vote here have vote native state ",0
long rant from aap supporter answers for all your questions you think that aap the only honest party and arvind some kind messiah arvind says that gadkari corrrupt that you will start running around with pitchforks and torches but ignore the news when gadkari proven innocent arvind says that bjp congress you aaptards being intellectually lazy will just accept gospel truth without asking why are raman singh jaitley shivraj vasundhra modi goa corrupt infact they are some the most honest intelligent and progress driven politicians india since very long time unlike aap bjp actually takes action against part members who act retarded case point jethmalani jaswant reddy kesubhai and many others compare that aap one founding members bhushan hardcore anti nationalist shazia caught accepting bribes even before election action against them defectors are given tickets arvind himself plays mulla appeasing policies numerous times aap just bunch idealist lefties who keep shouting the loudest that all politicians are thieves people being stupid accept the generalising statement and convert aaptards without checking the truth still don necessarily hate aap just think that bjp much better option also that most aap fanbois are just fanbois who can think thing themselves added later also point about aap fans being retards proven the downvote campaign which the resident aaptards downvote all comments after every such post proves point that aaptards are just bunch intellectually empty fanbois even the seems naive with his silly questions ,1
because aapturds eat poop then they poop and they use write false promises that why they are called aapturds,0
 politics part the unholy duo religion politics which brings out some the most emotional and impassioned read holds barred slug flamewars the web expect people argue beyond region and logic ,1
 have said time and again most people arent shallow minded like the aaptards think vote single agendas agendas which they know unrealistic and just are plain rhetoric dont blame for not having the tunnel vision that you lot are afflicted with corruption does not mean effective governance rather live corrupt nation but one that provides relatively better governance than honest state that just stagnates you didnt understand what said the previous para that exactly the problem with aaptards and you need expand your political perspective ,1
aap the new congress congress issues certificates secularism aap issues honesty anybody who comes from any party and joins congress becomes insta secular similarly all the odd mlas who went from bjp cong aap because they were rejects their own party have become insta honest way just like cong the gangotri indian secularism aap the yamnotri honesty ,1
thanks for proving once again that aap supporters are bunch immature bholas having deep rooted casteist and communal views this why easy for congress make fools out you they split their opposition vote and made delhi ungovernable and you stupids fell for their game plan and still haven wisened hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa troll ,1
problem with aap they are like worker union leaders sure they have honest intentions but then again not sure good union leaders would make good mds maybe wrong here but how much will ways aap survive reality still unknown even maharashtra prithviraj chavan was almost forced resign when exposed ajit pawars corruption even helpless what can you expect from others corruption like vicious network intertwined and ingrained into indian society should focus changing society unlike aap dudes who think bringing some law going improve things practically speaking bjp right choice about aap nothing can said how can perform national level ,1

great appreciate your efforts and this healthy way debate and criticise opponents not the kind which involves baseless lies rumors and team foreign funding crap tired those now which for some reason bjp followers think more effectice don know who told them that because only pisses off and more damage than good bjp itself and since you mentioned your post and made clear our discussion that corruption the issue for will track this post and engage ina discussion once you address that point because matter what good policy you come with unless you can implement the ground they mean nothing and this why before anything want corruption addressed share with how modi planning fight corruption ,1

 perhaps they fear they may lose small fraction voter base they either support oppose hopefully they will come with their views soon what think the problem that many individual party members may have personal opinion but they don want say anything against the party lines this just personal view party traditionally with right center views and the fact that they are mum about the supreme court having reverted the decision made the delhi high court fear they agree with but hope they take stance soon not having opinion all the worst stance for any political party especially issues relating human rights 377 homosexuality any other especially when party has strong candidate running for ,0
 critical issue nice priorities bro for the record fully endorse the repealing the archaic law which needlessly protrudes into the bedrooms consenting adults but dont get carried away except tiny tiny minority urban centers one gives shit this issue ,0

 really have very little issue with bjp economic policies think they have the clearest agenda among big parties more concerned with the social aspects their agenda they also are doing terrible job the opposition and are known pretty corrupt ,0
 like bjp should put this their manifestos anyway least the middle class and the business community will find attractive please continue you have more one suggestion read trade magazine some time ago about how employees maruti factory were striking for wages the tune whopping lakh illustrated how our labor laws had driven salaries unsustainably high many manufacturing sectors and stymied india efforts become manufacturing hub how even bangladesh was having more success than this regard fact this why many indian manufacturers seem hire disproportionately high percentage contract labourers work their factories they don have pay them the same high rates from this would say labor reform and reducing the power unions something else that needs considered the hidden policies that are wait ,1

why should bjp say anything there law has amended scrapped the government can introduce the new law parliament and depending the new law bjp can choose support not the problem posted the other thread day back most people are misunderstanding that the article 377 against homosexuals covers wide range issues and the foundation for other laws also makes lot heterosexual acts unlawful including general terms blowjob and anal sex you read and understand the entirety the law then you will understand that doesn mention homosexuals and applied against them should the law scrapped sure but before that see that since this the only law that covers sodomy guess india will also need laws covering rape male female another male also not sure the new rape laws 2013 protect male child not coz they not then this the only law per understanding which can use punish the criminal law not against homosexuals applied against them can applied against heterosexuals also scrap but create new laws first replace this law someone from the legal fraternity can ama and answer our questions about article 377 and rape abuse laws india will great clearing the misinformation ,1
politically would stupid move take stand right before the elections maybe that the reason,0
 would like bjp come out support scrapping sec 377 but won expect them make comment this because there are lot religious organizations which are against scrapping 377 and support bjp there might loss support bjp takes stance this close national elections might not work well bjp does not have presence many states would not like alienate whatever support has other parts meenakshi lekhi pointed out her tweets this ruling doesn make any difference the act between consenting adults neither them will file fir police won come checking around your bedroom see what you are upto just that will illegal act eyes law congress the other hand has come support scrapping this law openly this spite asg arguing for the law guess congress knows won forming the next government any stand takes issues won hurt them much ,0

politics 101 country that medieval minded the one hand and seeks 21st century capitalistic interests the other ,0
let put forward some problems and issues the first problem solved define sodomy and what acts are included presently blowjobs anal sex etc are illegal for everyone the major question arises whether allow fucking the assholes yes then should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well lesbians having sex fine until they are not really penetrating anything you would wonder then how could called sex but they wish use sex toys for the same they are not allowed owning selling producing sex toys banned india sex toys are allowed india again the question arises should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well even the act sex needs defined the present definition wont stand the point does not affect single law affects plenty laws commenting the issue would mean lot things and believe unless someone has clear idea what other effects that might have the existing laws she should refrain from commenting its good supporting opposing something but doing without knowledge inappropriate ,1
critical issue lol one cares ,1
this would issue these people were prosecuted under 377 and thrown jail tbn and9gctljwbsdyreogwxjxqaeakwn eauxr95fn6ylsdimxltrmsi3lh jpg jpg pride15 jpg agree that the article joke which also criminalizes heterosexual oral anal sex however practice person only charged one the individual not adult the act committed without consent yeah archaic law that needs but doesn harm anybody hence political party stance the issue irrelevant ,0

from another thread want ask how can someone who will purportedly run clean political party start his career with lies committing character assassinations honest people and not apologizing when the accusations not amount anything then there the matter persistent muslim appeasement style politics claiming batla house encounter was fake then when people tried pin him down doing volte face and saying that agreed with the court judgement the point note that the judgement had been out for months when the offending aap pamphlet came out approaching the muslim electorate not citizens but flock who can pimped out sundry maulanas like taqeer raza taqeer raza has been indicted for giving out fatwa behead tasleema nasreen yet when asked kejri brazened out saying let someone produce proof that taqeer raza issued fatwa when there are cases against him running courts for this very thing also the volte faces are far too frequent some gent writing for indian exponent criticized economic vision document aap website link below today that document gone from aap website there stand that aap will not give will not play well the mediia what can trust them for aam aadmi party aap economic vision been disappointment far html then there are previous baseless allegations aap went town claiming that bjp candidates have criminal cases against them when the reality that almost all cases are for crimes like unlawful assembly these are the exact kind cases that kejriwal and many aap candidates themselves are facing given that bjp was the principal opposition the capital for the past years its natural that most such cases for public protests will against the bjp candidates how can you trust the allegations coming out his mouth when willing indulge such cheap tactics please dont think that saying these things bjp supporter was vocal supporter the iac movement going the extent taking half day leave and joining protest the now feel cheated that kejriwal has used the support well meaning people like launch himself career active politics which neither intellectually nor ethically equipped handle any case not trying tell you whom support but former iac supporter want say that dont find aap politics any different from any other political party ,1
 you have provided options aap haters per your tiny winy kuchhi pucchi chhotu motu understanding indian politics with all due respect may ask for provision nota ,0
" like aap for its stand corruption and making people aware about their civic duties and mobilizing youth take part active politics hate aap for its communist ideology public appeasement policies minority appeasement which are not very different from congress and for its arrogant and holier than thou attitude

 are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party think this illustrates why people hate the followers aap with vengeance much fucking smug stupid that they can power thousand suns which have died down and turned into barren stars edit also this thread posted nri muslim nri muslim lethal combo ,0
and let not forget most the aap are kinda naive believing that once these folks get power their problems will fixed the shitty truth won and can the way they would want edit but respect them for shaking things ,1
 why you hate other parties apart from aap how does khujli dick taste are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party you support some party because your caste religion brahmins bjp and muslims congress you don believe corruption can eradicated indian politics ,0
your questions are absolutely ridiculous and shows how out touch with reality you are the world not all black and white just because someone votes for support particular party doesn mean they hate the others definitely don hate aap don like their solutions problems and don care for their style politics don see how anyone can logically expect adding more bureaucracy lokpal solve the problem corruption that was created too much bureaucracy begin with similarly their election promises free water and cheap electricity everyone what one the richest cities the country backward step when should moving away from govt subsidies for everyone all means support the poorest the poor with all the subsidies the world but there reason why the govt should lose money powering the air conditioned bungalows the super rich delhi the poor barely have any electric appliances this country the only way they are going able pay for such subsidies increasing tax revenues which will primarily impact businesses negatively and the domino effect will affect job creation etc aap anti capitalist tilt pretty evident anyone who isn totally blinded their anti corruption talk just because they claim have good moral stand corruption doesn mean should blindly trust them with all aspects governance clearly lot people delhi not agree with and that perfectly fine they are entitled their opinions and choices just like entitled mine ,1
 many assumptions man just many least try possible neutral and unbiased you going for discussion ,1
 dont hate aap but your questions are example why disagree with their style politics your mind people who disagree with aap hate aap they are blind supporters some other party are corrupt caste ist there room for disagreement with aap and still honest upright citizen who wants good things for his country this extremism one the reasons why dislike the aap ,0
 always hated self righteous morons ,0
what hate about aaptards they mentally convinced themself that kejriwal the only option any other argument met with vehement resistance anti corruption rhetoric and personal attacks both myself and the party person defend can abide naked hypocrites self denial people who like hide from things they don want see and hear the last couple days heard kejriturd compare atal behari vajpayee scamohan singh also heard response modi honesty sound economic policies consisting nothing but anti corruption rhetoric the age old 2002 riots propaganda simply absolute silence and finally complete lack awareness interest the political realities scenarios aside from bjp congress bhai bhai lokpal swaraj kejriwal will save some deeply flawed and full holes way ,0
why can disagree with aap policies without agreeing the reasons you have provided this ploy many who wants label somebody anti something for example you don temples you athiest you not hindu etc etc the simplest all reasons that self righteousness and pragmatism cannot mixed sometimes you will have take decisions that are unpopular against well established principles keeping mind future benefit and common good you cannot flexible such situations you are not doing any good administrator politician ,1
 corruption just matter legality financial irregularity and bribery the currency social transaction egregiously unequal society which power continues concentrated the hands smaller and smaller minority imagine for example city shopping malls whose streets hawking has been banned hawker pays the local beat cop and the man from the municipality small bribe break the law and sell her wares those who cannot afford the prices the malls that such terrible thing future will she have pay the lokpal representative too does the solution the problems faced ordinary people lie addressing the structural inequality creating yet another power structure that people will have defer you and your chutiyaapa,0
 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,1
 don hate aap but doubt their intentions ,0
 just small party with noble goals their ideology seems bit muddled and bit too idealistic lots parties start out like this lot things their initial manifesto seemed very poorly thought out maybe that has changed but ultimately just like every other election there will mostly hung parliament and leadership will decided horse trading with shifty state level parties mamata jayalalitha mulayam singh cpm karunanidhi etc etc this one the things that holds progress back frankly whether bjp aap bjp power the country will the shitter really wonder how people think otherwise just look the last years after independance people really think regime change has huge effect anything for example home state west bengal had regime change the party tmc came power with huge promises barely see any difference honest think both the cpm and tmc are awful when power changes hands move from set thugs another not really strongly pro any party highly doubt any party will easily fix corruption india generally very jingoistic very young and strongly influenced peer groups facebook twitter media lot people here are right leaning and pro hinduism very small community and not really the kind place where you will find ton debate topics like this will generally very polarized generally don discuss politics with people since just reflection their adherence group think ,1

this very good stuff thank you for taking the time post here all the points you raised and the discussion points this thread have with government investment know this necessary but not the full picture there needs very strong emphasis removing excessive laws and regulation take your point raising revenues for the government you have listed five but there unthinkably large number activities people could only starting and running businesses didn involve interacting government officials second third tier towns the government can just provide basic services roads water internet millions small business owners could relocate out choked cities and spur local growth the opportunities are endless consider the city mysore under the classification the five would pretty much fall squarely under tourism but the government could give better power more reliable communications and better roads bangalore could very easily transformed into hub the revenues that come out the ecosystem will far exceed any the original five categories ,1
 see aap followers are conspicuous their abscence here the ideas seen here make you uncomfortable don want reminded kerjiwal non existent plans for economic revival and repairing the damage wrought the upa don like hearing good solutions that the aap can provide ,1

for political party coming out nowhere not totally true but look their competition and completing their first anniversary only recently even they win seat will huge win for indians like who hope for better india who left better career prospects abroad stay india and something about the state affairs here the india which gandhi and patel and maulana and nehru and ambedkar and prasad and lalaji and gokhale and many others dreamt which kalam dreams which every citizen dreams the meantime you can cry some more ,1
 seems that they are taking congress too html vishwas believed keen fighting from rahul gandhi constituency amethi had earlier said have applied for lok sabha ticket from amethi and the committee will decide this html robert vadra issue there because involves famous person the fact everything like this happens everyday haryana certificate change land usage happens everyday one the well known analyst haryana chaudhary said that don have corruption haryana brazen loot course will make issue think aap extremely positive development for india they certainly have shifted the center gravity indian politics the cleaner side ,1
aap going eat away the congress and the regional parties vote much more than the bjp vote per the last known internal calculations aap expected get around seats while the bjp would still around 200 the biggest perceived advantage aap that they would contain the gandhis and the top congress leadership the seats being fought gandhis any loss there even significant decrease victory margin would huge egg the face situation ,1
aap has divided youth voters they are not dividing caste religion most the immature fanatics are young people who haven seen 1990 ,1
hahahaha aap supporter but boy love the fact they have made bjp and moditards run shit scared like headless chickens think the country owe big thanks arvind kejriwal just for making moditards realise they have not won the elections already ,1
lets steps want congress free india corruption free india ans corruption free does bjp has image being corruption free and would make india corruption free ans there party that gives that hope ans yes there are aap loksatta which are mostly going come together how can bjp fight ans definitely not lame arguments the team but beating aap their own game become more accountable the people rti transparent disclose funding sources remove criminals field better candidates and not the likes bokhariya radadiya yeddurappa until bjp ready compromise with its election strategy based our demands see reason whatsoever compromise with demands and vote for bjp this the only way fight aap not incessant wailing splitting hair and definitely not ridiculous fear mongering ,1
 there chance for the aap win any kind majority the 2014 lok sabha elections nor will any other political configuration have entered the world post election coalition parties you are making the assumption that congress gone that the third front will bad would not count either those technically would stupid for aap not try test waters let see how the results come out also please understand that not everything about bjp modi please try remember that when you examine what aap does ,0
aare you referring that aap should not contest just because would cause political unstablitiy shud india declared state for the dynasty politics bjp and congress would against religion kill dont make take arms not stopping you make stupid comments reddit and raising confusing topic have vote and would happily give aap matter what politics equation means end doesnt justify means,0
majority the voters dont even know what aap can tell you andhra pradesh tamil nadu aap the best case may cause swing votes the capitals this like the best case scenario they will not anything outside the metro regions government decided the smaller towns and villages urban folk dont give shit cant affect the outcome ,1
itt aapturds talking about corruption and revolution bjptards talking about saving the country good governance,1
how political suicide they win and end with hung assembly the regional parties have been doing the exact same thing for the past years unlike them aap would end forming government being part third front ,1
arvind kejriwal thousand times better than congress opposition will make sure that bjp does not become another congress aap only helping achieve the target congress mukt bharat should welcome aap entry the scene although not supportive unfair amount media attention being given them ,1
false dichotomy either you are for for bjp you are out destroy the nation whoever has heard opposition that does their job properly and keeps the ruling party line ,0
eli5 why does everyone else has nothing speak against namo except the riots mean has only one catch not juding him innocent guilty ,0
man even though support aap would like bjp come power with absolute majority just because lot people strongly feel that they are the need the hour and bjp not make people lives better both economically and socially hope their supporters would criticize them enough make them change seek alternatives other than congress and bjp they perform well and good for everyone ,1
great post hope bjp supporters will explain their points and arguments against the aap succinctly systematically and without vitriol and aap supporters will forego their usual self righteousness and listen ,1
first all kudos you for summarizing some very thoughtful points against aap such articles are rare come this subreddit where most the political discussions end descending karma grabbing mud slinging matches and deserves more upvotes have your questions except for their infinite faith and ability simply presume good what the aap supporters base their support believe that the most the supporters have put their faith the past record activism one man arvind kejriwal which pretty much synonymous the case bjp main man narendra modi both their records are out the open for everyone see and fair kejriwal has been tireless social worker even before the whole anna thing blew guess both bjp and aap supporters need asking this question what happens when the sole leader doesn live the promises you vote for person ideology system how ensure that everyone sticks that ideology system modi fan myself but find very difficult answer that well the long run what can aap give that the congress didn and couldn only time will tell that one but most people are hoping for corruption free government lets see how far they take delhi the power collective good intentions the water and power policies not seem panning out how earth aap different from congress under the sun today same old minority appeasement same old subsidy tricks same old attacks narendra modi seems like aap the mirror image congress only under different guise you got there other than few fresh faces the same old system compromises over accountability hoping proven wrong they are freaking corrupt why the heck are aapians not putting them jail instead taking their help this what want understand give this one aap for they didn back down play the dirty game the situation demanded but there was good chance that bjp might have swept more seats there was election also their conditions stunt was just childish nonsense ,1
 short ideologically aap congress corruption bjp supporters needlessly worry about losing votes congress who should scared because their voters will gravitate towards aap what aap offering socialism which does appeal large section indians bjp more free market and has the baggage rss ,1
 find the question loaded bjp the standards which you need evaluate parties hint bjp not that awesome variety options better for functioning democracy left centrist party with baggage always welcome your points only bit worrying rest are just array silly exaggeration wrong assumption misrepresentations facts sure aap has its foibles but they are fresh kids with much less bad things than other parties come give them time prove their worth bit early write them off ,1
 long they dont all right wing nuts and don have support from the likes kamdev and assaaram which the bjp has with aap ,1
 this the reason d84nwor r3a have started discussion elaborating apprehensions about aap hate aap because aap acting proxy for congress their jihad against narendra modi ,0
 bjp has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like subramanian swamy clearly scholar learned person gentleman whose opinions should mull over analyze and imbibe with immediate effect ,1
long story short most indian voters are not really knowledgeable enough think too deeply about such things they support the aap mainly because the promise new messianic figure kinda like modi without any the baggage existing political parties ,1
bjp offering modi aap can offer anything worse than that tried ,0
all those questioning aap taking support congress different people have different views his you asking why did take support congress others say should take congress support form government and show what can deliver the country now please you tell who should listen who would you have listened had you been his shoes the choice not simple but has listened his heart that what any sensible person his position would have done yes might succeed his commitments might fail but then the people are watching him closely should not atleast give him chance prove himself only been few days now and has stirred the political class with his stern decisions did bses ever dreamed that they will audited just within days becoming delhi can you already see the fears political class and corrupt the decisions and steps aap taking noone one amongst just like the friend you have who you roam around with everyday not vip just common man but his actions are not common all ,0
 skulduggery aap made lofty impragmatic and somewhat unattainable promises but didn’ get into cumbersome details they kept deliberately vague how these promises would kept please read the manifestos the promises are nowhere tall the ones made modi for example the aap spuriously promised give 700 litres free water the poor and according media reports they delivered all good then right but they did not deliver they only gave metered houses not the poorest people the slums who actually are the need that water this actually gives incentive the people delhi get metered installed besides although subsidized should not free there will lack motivation save seems unrestricted even only certain level average consumption middle class family more less 700l the limit acts encouraging factor conserve since can relieve them the bill opposition nuclear energy honestly totally disagree with this move however still need wait for official statement the issue because the reason why aap protested against the kundankulam was due their perception lack safety measures their flawed economic model the biggest problem they are yet release clear well defined description their economic policies and models but this should give sense what their stand ,1
man you should write article for paper honestly ,1
 aap grows large enough will split into various factions like the janata party did each these factions will handle the different criticisms one will hindu aam aadmi party another will pro nuclear aam aadmi party yet another will free market aam aadmi party ,1
the bjp you claim more free market but don think opposition fdi retail they might have their reasons those reasons might justified but still not free market economics questioned modi tendency towards free market economics when his government banned gutkha not spitting and public littering but gutkha while leaving the ban alcohol intact not elegant enforcement penalties domestic violence public misbehavior but easy brute force ban alcohol the ban gutkha caused drop areca nut prices don know about gujarat specifically but speaking couple farmers karnataka where the congress govt banned gutkha understood there was drop about prices much for free market economics this concern regarding anti laissez faire was accentuated bjp leaning towards preserving culture the recent official declaration their homophobia was just example one would want question the sanity the thought processes the upper rungs the bjp the congress too hasn shied away from culture preserving stances example the statements made the mangalore mayor condemning resort culture following the attack group reveling teenagers resort you asked what the aap will differently from the congress the aap was among the first political parties come out against section 377 the ipc that criminalizes anal and oral sex the bjp was among the first support forthrightly and directly criticize homosexuality western disease the congress came out against section 377 but seems more like move salvage some support when elections are around the corner despite having been power since the 2009 statement issued the delhi high court the congress motives here are questionable they also going after the power generation companies delhi irregularities are found expect lot high ranking politicians will incriminated this one more item that the aap will differently from the congress the aap seems delivering election promises however vague words have been followed actions unlike the congress you might consider not delivering water unmetered customers bad thing but this certainly encourages all customers install metered connections further consider such policies socialist something against given voluntarist leanings but this still better than crony capitalism where land offered throw away prices corporates such practices are the beginning the rise monopolies monopolies are irreversible without socialist revolutionary intervention between the aap and the bjp still undecided whom would vote for but the bjp doesn have that great case against the aap you make out while the aap might have displayed socialist tendencies the modi government hasn exactly displayed laissez faire the bjp whole not sure about given their spectacular failure karnataka you might worship subramanian swamy but think nut job you might say nationalism but say self righteousness and the bjp and their conservative culture touting support base has lot would much rather spend government money subsidies than statue not that proponent the former ,1
brilliant post but not hopeful the single nerve cell aap supporters share available here for them able give you proper reply ,1
 believe the sub was banned for vote brigading what shame major blow spreading your right wing propaganda ,1
thank you real chief thank too reported them while ago ,1

 had noticed too anti aap comments were getting large upvotes even though they were the same old arguments same old accusations sane comments reply these comments were getting large downvotes was hoping mods make another quality discussion has gone down announcement aiyyoiyer can testify since been commenting for aap side lot lately looking for the threads where saw this behavior question will those threads still show the large downvotes even after the users getting banned edit thanks ,1
absolutely agree with you subsidies the worst solution will eventually lead increased taxes secondly their ideology based time tested failed model thirdly fear that they come power they may nationalize everything which seems very possible looking their present ideology ,0
very well done what kapil sibal and upa did the mods india are doing now and this was for criticizing aap isn kudos ,1
modi4pm had just for commenter gold mods wtf,0
 people are interested knowing what were doing namoarmy were touch with couple bjp leaders get them ama this sub and that requires quite good deal effort considering that reddit not mainstream india but aap idiots who are already phd certificatebaazi have gone ahead and get banned because they think were gaming votes ,1
this not community some 200ish people who happen from india isnt this india where the topics discussion should about india and not about some frequent india visitors for any personal rebuttals name calling etc etc cant use instead its shame see the top post india bitch fight like this please correct wrong ,1
those that ran that sub were carrying out suspicious activity basically downvoting every comment that was against the bjp then downvoting any thread that had anything against the bjp was pretty sure that activity since when the downvotes would come they arrive huge numbers since was private sub many couldn see the activity that was happening there fuckers got jolt ,1

interesting not banned yet how come ,1
wtf why ,0
woah this sounds incredibly petty five out the top ten posts india right now carries positive stories about aap are you guys engaging vote brigading then modi4pm was troll for most part don know why was banned aap supporters seem more intolerant criticism than bjp supporters ,1
congratulations thank you for showing faith aap ideals and making sure the hive mind brainwashed into accepting our superiority for this effort you are awarded with 100 more free water and your power bill will further slashed ,1

 train sabhi yatriyon top lels diya jaye ,1
 posted whole ago context ,1
 dont get one thing the subreddit concept can greatly used for containment like circlejerk namoarmy wants furiously masturbate and upvote namoarmy what the problem still didnt understand how the ban and your description related because they were influencing upvotes other subs ,1
isn there mod setting whereby new users account age day old week old even month and users with low comment karma lets say 1000 both metrics for india are prohibited and limited comments per hour time frame the sub this won affect users with account age older than year and comment karma low hundreds seen few these users and they are mostly nice and only engage posts which are off beat these guys are lurkers anyway doesn affect them most them won reading the recent useless drama here anyway this account age restriction can extended even year strat ever perfect but one major benefit this would the incentive just act like tool without fear getting banned would less because the cost just creating new account and engaging more right away will increase dramatically there incentive build repo and since time and effort will have been spent user build that account she will act better more cases than currently the case said strategy perfect but its about managing the chaos one should learn useful aspects from the best the chinese censorship apparatus they don ban most things outright that never works instead their most common approach make the user experience hell and shitty possible why would someone use facebook some other site service every minutes the connection timing out slow and what not the incentive use longer there those who will persist their numbers will fall rapidly and very low and the goal achieved mods should work this direction they can not ban everyone and shut shop they need make the situation for idiots not worth their while spent all this time spreading here ,1
"more than the modi clan find this clan very prevalent india its not about who gets win the election for them its about spreading well rehearsed propaganda seems here the cheat sheet for that particular clan praise aap downvote blame aap upvote disguised praise about rss upvote rss with negative word the same sentence downvote

criminals defacing websites critical namo makes you wonder just what kind crowd supports modi ,1
feku still alive looks like the hackers just made those websites first and later changed the contents pretty intelligent stuff ,1
these seem like mostly satire fun sites rather than ant modi dick move the part who tried deface them although the trauma getting someone read that dhoom3 quote far more criminal,1
 know most those sites and they usually spring around election time and are funded rival political interests cannot say feel any sympathy for these guys they essentially just run hate sites for political purposes ,0
yeesh the aap vote brigade getting more obvious and disgusting the day just check any threads posted recently even this very comment and the admins ban policy opaque even moderators spoken admit they aren told shit about the people charge reddit are gunning for the aap they may well put post clearly spelling out their political inclinations ,0

where did you pull out the figure 270 for nda think its gonna more like party seats won nda 220 cong 120 aap other 170 reasons case you are forgetting bjp hardly has any powerful allies now 270 being like way too optimistic cong tally 120 may seem low but guess thats their best case scenario anti incumbency strong against them look how they were wiped out from delhi and rajasthan that context guess 120 the best congress will aap again best case scenario although highly doubt this number myself but given the limelight they are right now its not totally impossible others 170 this where the action this has bsp tmc dmk aiadmk bjd cpi cpm jdu jds etc said most are congress friendly pseudo secular parties,1
sorry know this isn what you asked just venting frustration here aap has thrown everything off but they keep this nationalisation anti fdi reservation increased quotas referendums for everything hopefully they won get many votes watching ndtv now listening rabbi shergill singer aap talk about how growth bad that mnc are evil american corporations delhi gov freakin reversed the decision fdi that previous government took after years deliberation less than month this action alone will raise red flags the investment community there respect for continuity their actions will back wearing langotis and burning cow dung aap comes power wholeheartedly thank congress for supporting aap delhi because quite clear they are leftist radicals waiting cut off india from the rest the world expected good governance anti corruption yet see any major person tried let alone jail ,0
vote for government rather than candidate the brightest candidate from your constituency can shit get unstable corrupt government bedeviled with policy paralysis 2014 there are only three choices for government congress allies upa bjp allies nda others aap bsp cpm cpi aidmk dmk jdu jds etc third front possibly supported congress ,0

 modi says vote for india will vote for party which can provide stable government the center which has leader like modi someone who dreams big strong decisive and can make things happen helps build culture against nepotism and one hard work and success,1
namo party only condition call something other than that ,0
this interesting guess most bjp skeptics might just have change heart ,1
that would the best way separate the hindu extremist clan from the real believers development among the current bjp clan wish namo would that would not only just vote for him actively campaign from him distances him from that rss driven bjp ,1
and exactly what relevance does this hold anything ,1
this was written mahatma gandhi how can this attributed modi edit not joking because was surprised when found this stuff the mahatma but then his writings about blacks are worse edit did not mean that the thing was written gandhi what meant was that this was gandhi philosophy for example even arguing for untouchables right walk through temple street gandhi would say that they might untouchable due karma but they have the right passage very perverse attitude and was criticized ambedkar lot modi wrong adopting the same line but this what happens when person idolized father nation and what not ,1
should have directly linked the article here htm ,1
will some well meaning modi supporter just come out and say this particular view modi wrong but that this shouldn the only determining factor judging candidate people have faulty views certain things rather than aggravating debate making unrelated points about some other party would more helpful modi supporter just says wrong much debate for nothing ,0
this guy pure religious fundamentalist guy pakistan mistake was being islamist country and this man wants india hindu country religion and nationalism deadly cocktail ,1
aap slowly turning into congress day passes real issues against modi repeat same issues that congress has already tried only one agenda for election stop modi any how ,0
let see 400 million people live poverty how about becoming self sufficient before supporting refugees lol the vote bank politics never ceases amuse ,1
there absolutely citation with this quote yet note how anti modi guys are using this make their case against modi while pro modi guys are coming with justification for the quote both sides believes the quote real ,1
well the end the day believe you are facing atrocities particular place you have the right leave now bangladesh see only hindus that are being persecuted while muslims are not hence rest case ,1
try better aaptards ,1
turn back now the comments this thread are absolutely shit ,0
 really wonder the logical dissonance this post modi may very well think this but point out one example such thinking leading the exploitation the valmikis gujarat under his administration long his policies aren affected such views which may add were put forward seven years ago there reason criticise his leadership here edit downvotes why ,1
even though not practicing christian christian born and indian citizen this frightens thought modi was different bjp leader pushing national unity and all sad ,0
actually bangladeshi hindus should accommodated india for the very reason muslims are part this country much hindus when india was partitioned two nations were formed india and pakistan while india chose remain secular nation giving equal rights all least theory pakistan chose become islamic nation where hindus not have the same right muslims india has accommodate all muslims who wish part this country because founders our nations decided this people may grudge this decision but have accept and fulfill this promise pakistan the other hand doesn have accommodate them and doesn try much fact that hindus bangladesh are suffering because religious persecution also fact that muslims bangladesh are not suffering due religious persecution first rule anyone illegally coming from bangladesh india must deported but humanitarian causes take precedence and based that hindus should accommodated india know that many hindus their hate for modi are willing forsake hindus bangladesh little more understanding the situation required bangladesh was same india then hindus and muslims bangladesh would equal people are overlooking the fact that hindus and muslims are not equal bangladesh hindus and muslims are equal only india and hence this contradiction use pakistan and bangladesh interchangeably for obvious reason not talking politics here anyone disagrees please debate not get your political agenda here ,1
 source will have accommodate hindus from bangladesh modi 1403963 html modi have responsibility toward hindus who are harassed and suffer other countries where will they india the only place for them ,0
apart from tweets couldn find any source him having said this leaving that aside don think any bangladeshi should allowed till sort out our own problems also though things should equal there are few grey areas though there might illegal immigrants from both religions which should strictly discouraged hindu immigrants might also victims ethnic cleansing which case they would and should have higher priority ,1
how anyone going verify the border who muslim and who hindu refugees could from either religion welcoming one set should welcome the other for those wanking over modi saying india the only place for hindus hindus can nepal bhutan any other country asia too india not hindu country secular country ,1
well what surprising what else one expects from bigot like narendra modi ,1
both are outsiders poor country and don have the resources support them kolkata victim refugees from bangladesh and suffers from huge influx them that happened during the 70s still get bangladeshis tricking through the border either the political parties here cpm tmc lure them and give them fake voter cards they come india dirt poor and put huge strain relatively poor states like and meghalaya and expected they get involved crime most people absolutely hate bangladeshi refugees and most bengalis ,0
goldmine for aaptards now these guys will really earn their money ,1
bangladesh exists for muslims that the whole reason they wanted separate from india muslims cannot live bangladesh what its point existing ,1
calm your tits guys the author excuse boy for aap appeasement what the congress does minorities when the aam aadmi party manish sisodia wore cap with common man written urdu nizamuddin auliya dargah the other day the other hand good politics sharma redefining politics 114010301235 html but course going jump every modi line when been declared aap enemy ,1
dat self righteous smug face lol first bangladeshi hindus are merely refugees but majority bangladeshi muslims are illegal immigrants and second what the most pita about bangladeshi muslims their sectarian and staunch anti national behaviour which causing huge disturbance most region ,1
 think that hindus both bangladesh and pakistan should given shelter india political asylum considering the international norms providing refugee politically abused and threatened people note that modi had said indian muslims are not indians that would not have been acceptable however giving refugee and integrating religious minorities from neighboring countries seems the right thing religious majorities those countries however need use legal modes immigration they wish rather than just cross over the border squat more resources ,1
 2002 every time some guy inserts the comment but what about namoarmy fyi modi was strong with was unbanned the admins ,1
upvote like discussions those involve controversies and love them even more when they are about ,1
 lokpal will clear corruption out india and even greater out indians highly unlikely corruption not crime but disease and remedy development education discipline change attitude laws and rules were enough change country years there would dowry khaps murders untouchability school donations india there would cocaine almost riots gujarat for straight years not because strict law against riots but because shift focus from religions roads and buildings administration and development lokpal aap what ram mandir bjp what poverty congress what reservation mayawati and mulayam,1
aap does not have the numbers get majority best you can hope for that the third fourth front get then they beg for aap support get who would then extract lokpal bill the cost for support ,1
 feel its herd mentality you see media and your friends criticizing and decide aap must bad uncool support anything they well how many have seen speech and read good news about him not many they don even read about and start calling him dramebaz surprised that people who oppose aap are against everything they well think has become ego issue many the people ,1
 the first place aap having real idea solution for any issue besides corruption big hit them the second place they don even have real solution corruption lokpal farce exaggerated dream all does add yet another layer investigative bureaucracy over the acbs cbi intelligence agencies cag vigilance commission and judiciary with them involved investigations will take even more time now but whether corruption will punished different matter and till date have yet hear answer for the very simple point what the lokpal members are themselves corrupt corruption has seeped even into the independent judiciary then why what use independent lokpal that leaves with reason vote for the aap this year beyond being disgusted and wanting spite the other parties which describes the majority their fans ,0
 much the chaddiwalas out here india and facebook shiver their panties aap does not have the number gain majority and form the government modi going but aap could possibly form the opposition party and that could keep nda its toes ensure does not indulge too much corruption ,1
 you mean say vote for aap pass bill assuming very strong bill and let the country debt the vague notions arvind kejriwal water subsidy kejriwal new all these its like you are making engineering graduate the ceo multi million dollar company its likely going fall and guess what any chance any kejriwal proposed plans not work again going resign the bill can not throw corruption out this country all highly unlikely that even going happen another hand modi will develop the country infrastructure wise may look into matters like improvement rural areas problems electricity and water shortage etc arvind kejriwal just like small kid planning for summer the kid will have huge plans won realize the hurdles ,1
thanks for sharing really needed some hope this morning thank you ,1
all looked lovely until read this was organized communist party who are the biggest goondas and murderers seems quite staged now,1
why this being downvoted you might ask both mochi and ansari were critical modi and his development model where development gujarat any talk development just sham still live footpath lal darwaza still single can afford get married because financial status said mochi ansari said modi posing with muslim leaders trying cultivate the impression that the community now with him the truth that the bjp has done nothing for muslims people living other states should know this truth that the reason have come with the book said ansari ,0
both unmarried but jaya goot more saries,1
 thought had huge power problem and industry was going out because anyways amma came back think 2011 only before that was dmk power there while modi has been office since 2001 against earthquake which destroyed gujarat and redeveloped state from ,1
 don know much modi but far jayalalitha concerned she takes very few inputs from any section most the decisions are taken her within inner circles which imo she could have broader consultation would very good she has stern mind take bold decisions ,1
how this pro amma says has higher revenue much much higher excise revenue but same fiscal deficit the extra money going amma pocket ,1
 not modi fan but think ridiculous compare development metrics two very diverse states very simplistic way look the problem ,0
not fair comparison amma has hardly been power while modi his 3rd term amma previous track record not good she was voted the worst was worst governed state don remember back when she was power the 90s she seems have big aspirations read and has the potential deliver here hoping she turned over new leaf and doesn fuck things ,0
this infographic only shows you how developed itself but doesn say anything about what amma herself did this honestly useless you are comparing modi and amma ,0
seriously did you infographic maker even consider the fact that alcohol tax revenues are significant contributor the treasury top off sells almost all its alcohol from tasmac designated government liquor stores and has rule that only alcohol made can sold imfl this random edit really downvotes this why stopped posting india and even deleted account previously really irritating really says lot about the quality person who lurks here you can post decent rebuttal atleast have the sense refrain from discussion lazy press the button disrespectful the community one gives rat ass about reddiquette damn disappointing guys damn disappointing ,0

this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,1

what are the odds all this debris that has been spotted not from the plane since they are shifting the search 650 miles can debris travel that far days ,1
 basically received reports satellite images showing debris the southern indian ocean but one has actually put their hands any must less confirmed what any the debris ,1
 new search area pdf pdf looks like right top the diamantina trench ,1
the new search area very close diamantina deep considering how quickly the entire search force abandoned the previous location and that fact that the fbi was set have completed their analysis the captain hard drive they found diamantina deep his internet search history would both the kind credible evidence that causes complete shift search area but also something you absolutely could not release the public until confirmed with wreckage thoughts ,1
 does this debunk any ghost plane theories plane can make turns after new coords are input but never heard one automatically speeding ,1
 amsa and the atsb will hold press conference 1430 aedt provide more details the new search area does anyone know where this press conference might found online google skills are apparently lacking today ,1
amsa press conference live now ,1
here good graphic which have way verifying not sure already been posted not haven seen before shows overlay australia radar coverage and the last ping derived arc location the plane the arc goes straight through the satellite system which think already knew before someone highly motivated and with inordinate amounts free time could and stick there the various search areas and debris sightings that would super cool australia refuses confirm deny whether the plane was detected well according the trustworthy media but think either their system was down malfunctioned and they don want anyone know they did detect the airspace and are using that direct the search areas and are keeping secret for who knows why and need the doppler effect only cause cool either way can imagine that they did detect but are refusing use the info release other investigative agencies they spending boatloads money searching for this plane too and doesn make sense for them continue spending what they know incorrect also the plane was detected why would they keep that secret not like their satellite capabilities are secret don think this case the plane flying under the radar think this radar goes pretty low would have wasted enormous amount fuel and the pings probably would have cut off lot sooner think there good chance the plane passed through this region and wasn detected for whatever reason jpg,1
question possible the plane was programmed just before 000 fly that way until ran out gas and everybody board was dead ,1
 think easier hide plane for weeks than crash one and try find especially with countries and shitload satellites 24hr prowl with the whole world demanding answers ,1
 update still found debris black boxes evidence the pilot remain standstill ,0
 aircraft arrived new search area and have not found anything that would classify debris australian official says html,1
live giving update search watch ,1
the elephant the room that more than likely none the debris that the satellites picked were wreckage from mh370 remember either hearing the news reading article about how ocean currents that part the world often bring together all the stuff ocean has collected over the years bystander and already felt hopeless and frustrated can only imagine how the families and search rescue team feel ,0
 the new analysis that the plane flew faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance these factors would lead less flight time but time air the most concrete fact the ping data confirms these points faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance work with the fact the plane must also the air for hours ,1
 confused they are saying the plane was traveling faster than they thought more fuel was being used traveled shorter distance but they have pings all the way assuming the plane had not yet crashed until least that moment which would have stopped the pinging there concrete amount time had the air how could travel less distance when was traveling faster for the same amount time are they saying that they overestimated whatever time after the plane was the air which would have had less than hour and that compensates for the decreased distance ,0
considering that the current search area takes hours get hours search and hours return for the hours flying time think everyone should thank their lucky stars that the new search area turned out 684 miles the northeast the current search area toward australia turned out 684 miles the opposite way the planes would have had nearly zero time the target search area before they had turn back fuel ,1
 look into the lives malaysia airlines flight 370 pilots lmyqjaxmta0mdiwodeyndgywj far they have turned nothing unusual the pilots ,1
given this new search area would that put the plane place where australian military should have picked ,1
just when you think they finally have solid search location another change another place been days like that that completely incredible three full weeks with sign not single piece that plane not blaming everyone just clarify know this has been unprecedented just find hard assimilate that has been this long ,1

expert organisations analyse available data and determine the best area search the key pieces information being analysed relate early positional information from the aircraft and
later polling satellite aircraft system the new information based continuing analysis radar data between the south china sea and the
strait malacca before radar contact was lost indicated the plane was travelling faster than previously estimated resulting increased fuel usage
and reducing the possible distance travelled south into the indian ocean the international investigative team supporting the search continues their analysis which could still
result further refinement the potential flight path this has been combined with information about the likely performance the aircraft—such speed
and fuel consumption for example— arrive the best assessment the area which the aircraft likely have entered the water the information provided the international investigative team the most credible lead currently
have the search aircraft wreckage however this information needs continually adjusted for the length time elapsed since the
aircraft went missing and the likely drift any wreckage floating the ocean surface finally let stress that under international convention malaysia has investigative responsibility for
malaysia airlines flight mh370 this stage the atsb’ main task assist the search for the
aircraft this day the search for the aircraft… have drifted the area for days movement taking into account the actual weather and known currents atsb spokesman unsure what the actual speed was the assumption that the aircraft was travelling somewhat constant speed data from satellite polling and radar matches satellite imagery may may not objects and may not debris fields previous search areas have now been abandoned could debris wind scattered around the world depending who picks – under international convention remains the responsibility the country where the aircraft was registered any wreckage which picked will held for the malaysian investigative teams atsb operating behalf the malaysians any debris picked must handed over australian authorities new area will help get more aircraft scene for longer the other benefit the search area longer the roaring 40s – which means better weather conditions more often debris has been seen the old search areas does not want classify satellite and visual spots those areas debris that just not justifiable with what have seen adds that this kind thing not unusual this the normal business search and rescue operations the new area based refined data possible that further analysis may change that again what are you actually refining the relationship between 777 performance satellite pings and various projections versus that information trying find the right coincidence those and the end point when the aircraft runs out fuel all engines die together there are range scenarios you still believe the course changed several times the best assessment the aircraft headed south consistently into the indian ocean are you looking other leads from the malaysian investigation the two primary methods are the analyses the movement the aircraft that the best information can have satellite imagery being followed but has produced sightings sophisticated oceanographic modelling determine drifts recall please that this days after the event was expected happen over that days there’ significant amount random dispersion objects the search area gets significantly bigger over time data marker buoys are being distributed into new search area continue model drift and keep search area confined all data currently available has been made available the search ",1
here another hammer their quickness abandon the search area based this new data analysis plane speed means they have literally zero confidence any satellite images they have released over the last week does this means satellite imagery just not good enough useful this search all find this hard believe but with this current abandonment all can conclude that there ton floating garbage debris the indian ocean and satellites not able distinguish these pieces well enough this may truly impossible cause folks ,0
the search area for flight has been updated after new credible lead was provided amsa more info here pdf,1
you know what seems fucked for and mind you this just train thought ordinary person these aircraft find debris drop navigation bouys subsequent aircraft and ships can swoop and pinch yet how many freaking bouys have they dropped and yet how many times have they gone for the search not saying fishy anything just wanted say how awfully difficult find any debris ,0

 have come the conclusion that lala will never adorable nanamo shrine her the best can achieve ,1
 really happy see the comments here very well explained all the redditors sans few jerks here and there what huge huge difference between aaptards and modi supporters ,1
 right fine with that india got divided the basis religion and non hindus got nation their own why shouldn india cater the need the hindus plight from those countries because are secular fuck that why did the partition happen the basis religions then gandhi fucked over ,1
many countries make distinction between policies for asylum seekers and migrants common sense really ,1
dae think india initiated this kind policy will only increase the incidences persecution minorities pak and bangla imo should done only case case basis discretely and not publicly announced blanket policy ,1
 against this very clear how this works support the man doesnt mean that idolise him support his every move blindly means the field leaders that have available believe the best bet lead bring ratan tata the candidate for any party and they will have vote tldr support does not mean worship,1
hmm think the whole against illegal immigration and wants illegal immigrants sent back but wherever hindus are the minority and are being persecuted bjp wants them move india seeing india the only hindu majority nation this world tried arguing against this logic pointing out that there are already millions hungry uncared for indians who should looked after first rather than foreign national just because she hindu being persecuted have responsibility neighbor urge bangladesh protect minorities but beyond that against this notion should deport all illegal immigrants irrespective their religion grant them asylum needed case case basis ,0
 take jab persons migrating legally should welcome all states should accommodate them infiltrators who enter the country illegally need tackled they tend disturb the regional functioning removed religious subtext less controversial interpretation ,1
very good ,1
this allowance refuge the base religion actually valid india was divided india east and west pakistan remember what basis religion bangladesh very much islamist state recognized hindus are seeking refuge due persecution they should allowed however muslims are crossing borders huge numbers than becomes whole new issue which would require diplomatic intervention ,1
old issue rehashed several time here modi wants india give asylum bangladeshi hindu refugees who came here escape persecution and growing islamic radicalism their home country increasingly common problem bangladesh but not bangladeshi illegal migrants general who just came here for economic opportunities because their numbers are simply massive and are causing major demographic changes several indian states ,0
what wrong with that another lame ass attempt modi bow wow ,0
 have answered this several times tldr whole heartedly agree persecuted hindus don have any other place earth except probably nepal somebody must help them ,1
 don need more poor people india are already nation with large scale unemployment and poverty why are allowing immigration people with little skills the reason why bjp wants pursue this create voting loyalists for the party congress has allowed unfettered immigration people belonging particular religion just increase its voter base ,0
there are two categories illegal migrants first are those who want come india for economic reasons secondly those who are persecuted should provide asylum those who are persecuted and send back those who came here for economic reasons support modi stand this ,1
modi communalist the little fucker knows bangladeshi hindus are not facing any problems india but has play saviour role which had done gujrat for more than decade pakistani hindus are crossing border rajastan and they are welcomed and are given out ration cards bjp each individual welcomed with celebration ,1
what sickulars say about this live bangladesh for some years bangladesh secular isn ,1
why only bangladesh hindu and christains from pakistan are killed raped and murdered even secularist should accept them plus according these countries are hindustan why not support him ,0
here take india was partitioned belief that muslims living india will continue live unharmed similarly hindus living west east pakistans will continue live unharmed india will considered hindu nation where hindus migrating from west east pakistan will welcome take refuge muslims from india are free migrate pakistan now that hindus are not being treated well and they want migrate nation which was created for them they are welcome but muslims have their nation result partition they are not happy with situation there then they should try improve situation rather than move across border not question about hindu muslim question national resources national security and rights indian citizens hindus bangladesh are much minority that you will not notice they migrate india but muslims are migrating much population that has created severe identity crisis east india and pakistan with support china trying take full advantage that situation think beyond your hatered for modi and put india before anything else you will realize are critical situation with major threat from pakistan and china and have handle favor india without giving communal color ,1
this weird ,0
 the real bhagoda ,1
 have only recently started follow indian politics but this seems absurd ,0
why don liberals who yap about the evils hindu society endorse modi right reject child marriage thrust upon him ,1
 hasn experienced one the greatest things the world virgin prime minister that probably first ,1
left his wife and spies young woman using state machinery the hero deserve ,1
 don care about his personal life but brought this upon himself was not right him deny her existence previous elections and now finally admit before this one the one who publicly claimed has one corrupt for reading indian express article about his wife she came off someone who still admires and respects modi and wished nothing but success for him taking that into consideration its begs the question how modi views women general ,0
international media will eat this especially when modi becomes the and goes international visits without first lady child marriage exotic india the western media would have field day ,1
the marriage breakdown really irrelevant the issue arguably why modi was not candid about far arguably the answer our extremely judgemental and conservative society ,0

mutually separated decades back this really news obviously the bankrupt political opponents will milk this for ever but modi grandiosely comesback jashodaben now that will some melodrama ,0
that was before she became honest and secular ,1
genuine question brother where you think comes from when says muslims hum paanch hamare panchees calls muslims mians edit well was waiting for your response can ask you some more questions not sure you reply again guess will just put them out there said muslims shouldn given relief camps after 2002 riots they turn camps into baby producing factories comment why you think never visited relief camp after 2002 went gaurav yatra pride rally after riots what you think was proud how you feel about maya kodnani being made cabinet minister 2007 when everyone knew her role riots why comment muzzaffarnagar ,1
 can see why namo appeal can see why some muslims would support him too anyway have question for you others you think modi bjp wins clear majority won have depend coalition partners can avoid the influence rss vhp the answer then what the worse that you think can happen india the answer yes then please explain why you think modi would able control bjp mps from around the country well was able control bjp mlas gujarat ,1

what are you talking about always seeing some analysis some modi speech his lack apology some other irrelevant news quip him his party allegedly doing wrong which article was pro bjp the comments overwhelmingly are the last week besides its fair game that aap don feature the top page aap party without any record party which shouts and shoots allegations appear the news and reddit rejects such type campaign then only shows certain level maturity what thoroughly shocking the complete absence congress supporters here ,0
how does the upvote and downvote work can make bot which will keep making new reddit accounts you don even email for that and keep upvoting submissions and make karma whoring overlord have tried upvoting submissions from numerous throwaway accounts like this one and seemed the downvotes were added automatically the downvotes were gone after removed upvotes whhat the deal here reddit ,1
 commenting here saw this link front page myth busted you might want spend more time rting shri ak49 instead making memes can judge which one more productive impactful though ,1
 shit posts like this getting 100 upvotes good indicator which way the most active redditors here lean they cultivated rock solid professional victimhood mentality and are jihad dharm yudh mode ,1

 think there has been drop funding elections near their end ,1
 not its just that people only talk where there some news talk about all are seeing same old that opposition shouting modi communal ,1
pointless sorry but don see the moral failings people who work hard have money and power and yes drink alcohol sad sack social observer types the other hand are the worst ,0
this will not change unless there societal change politicians will pander the masses when they want votes and nothing disallowed why surprising that the bigger parties can afford set their people fancy hotels ,1
 don see anything wrong with what bjp doing you have play caste card with win elections the hindi belt just because they are more organised and have better resources don make them evil ,1
bhai some one knows more kindly update his wikipedia page ,1
greatest piece apathete nonsense have ever heard just hate how people love because flowing piece literature ,1
 seriously wish somebody would tell what this ravish kumar trying say here that parties play caste politics that what fetches votes that moneyed interests support parties they support sin crime have money and support party your choice now right reserved only for the poor leaders cant wan raise stuff like poverty and retire expensive hotel why they need prove their aam nature sleeping the road mind you not critisicing supporting any one party here this all the reality india today and the people have gone large extent contribute tthis have you ever wondered why the south india has grown much faster clip because while caste important especially karnataka not hesitate vote outside caste norms are not satisfied with the governance the ruling party this why despite all the corruption here still leagues ahead laloo because knows cant sit his hands for years and ask for votes the name caste heck jaya brahmin and she wins landslide victories caste pox indian society even more north indian central indian states and that the absolute reality ,1
 have read extensively this election and sorry say that ravish kumar being partisan and giving one sided view here afraid will not surprised joins the aap soon like many other journalists ravish kumar talks caste politics and candidates being fielded the basis caste but acts like this exclusive bjp and congress which party does not field candidates caste and religion especially and bihar even aap has been doing the same thing many constituencies many their candidates many states are fielded according caste calculations vip candidates aap succumbs cong bjp ailments 1427157 html ravish kumar acts businessmen hotels have something with the elections are they campaigning for modi has seen them distributing pamphlets money even the businessman who publishing bal narendra comics has said only doing because wanted something that would sell not distributing free campaign material plus few tens thousands comics are completely insignificant voters national level the children who read them will not vote anyway and general ravish seems very disgusted their prescence why have private businessmen suddenly become evil ravish employer falls the same category and many the aap and bsp politicians seems rooting for are also big businessmen like sanyal balakrishnan etc ravish observes that aap and bsp politicians not use expensive hotels while others while simplicity admirable does not have any bearing politician skills administrator the left and tmc politicians west bengal and the communists kerala are known for their relative simplicity and modest lifestyles but they are otherwise very thuggish and have not delivered good governance for their states least for west bengal ravish should look relevant things like manifestos promises track records etc ,1
damn that was good write and translation too ,1
 ाी ें ़ा ि्ी ा ा आदर्ों ा िााा ें ूा ा्यकर्ा अपने ि ी े िों ी ्ा करता ोा the party workers actually work hard but who will tell the statistics them ,0
beautiful reads almost like poem ,1
 sad that every reporter who claims non partisan infact doing the bidding political party this was effort appeal the hindi speaking masses and love the construction but not the content how easily has bjp been accused indulging caste politics but there has been really been mention congress demanding all secular muslim votes the author failed mention that calling muslims secular all hindus are being labeled communal how easily has been forgotten that senior leader from aap demanded that muslims communal and the statement was later ratified the party the bjp has been accused putting star hotels but expenditure hoards aap workers being ferried air have been conveniently overlooked one cannot trust any form media person all everyone has make their own mind ,1
 would only like say war everything fair every party plays caste politics mean every ticket given the basis complex calculation what can you about this exactly what prompted selfpost how remove caste system that can come out this shit ,1
ravish far the best news reporter india his elections coverage has been exceptional and really both its freewheeling honest form and content unlike anything have ever seen life also seems the only one who can see through the absolute farce contemporary media their own sense exaggerated self importance really wish his prime time election coverage will win some sort award for outstanding journalism also great translation man thanks all the effort don disheartened the louts here who seem hogging the space with their inane posts need more posts like this edit ि् िाे ाा ी ्ा ीं करता ाे ाा ी करता ै । never knew ्ा could used verb also ूिा ु translates bhumihar dominated ,1
raveesh without doubt one the best reporter who does reporting from his heart however will not call him impartial seems have soft corner for aap and always shows that his writing and reports chooses ignore lot same politics played aap which congress and other parties are accused however still does not take away the fact that quality journo though not the impartial one think impartial journalism mere utopia ,1
 never hides his biharism that bihari makes extremely happy favorite new reporter never hides when doesn have complete knowledge particular subject fact says that first thing the program read his blog regular reader some the stuff there heart warming since have lived and seen those things ,1
nice translation hope more and more scribes emulate him rather than those loud mouthed scoundrels ,1
isnt this the obvious fact missing something here ,0
this gold have been reading his blog and those are awesome ,1

 much ridiculed for cleaning politics how can anyone delusional this kejriwal fellow arrived varanasi train claiming speech that has only 500 his pocket and then left varanasi after elections fucking aeroplane congress taught how easy fool people kejriwal taught how much easier actually the guy started platform anti corruption and ended with telling jazeera how modi was threat secularism how much more can man lie ,1
 appreciate sentiments especially when call for moderating behavior that said this election was way about aap aap continues the same line will lost oblivion within yrs deservedly the way left the entire corruption plank all out against sm1 who prolly the best leader have was not just stupid but unforgivable also think presumptuous assume that there tommorow aap india has resurged from far worse times thinking that only select band people can lead salvation horrible idea the same way congress led believe tht they were the only ones who freed india ,0
 don get all this aap small party some people here and look back their post history and check how many threads they have started criticizing aap aap small and inconsequential why the fuck are you people giving much attention you expect better subredit good luck with that the only thing that might change that the paid downvoters might disappear think they already have ,1
now that the results that they probably wont even open the account dawning aap supporters they are resorting the but got the moral victory route saw that twitter seeing here you might genuine but sorry the general experience dealing with the aap walas had made many man cynical some points aap not even strong regional party let alone national party let alone party replacing the congress mon party that many doubt will even open the account already your mind replacing congress maybe sometime the next decade but not now not even 2019 dont know what you mean aap revolutionized this election didnt see aap campaign anywhere except few pockets delhi amethi varanasi and few seats punjab compared the modi bjp blitzkrieg there comparison like not this election was about one and only man modi india against corruption was delhi movement not national movement attributing what was pan national phenomena cutting across rural urban divide high turnout delhi based movement sheer madness people are just getting more and more politically aware and the penetration internet rural areas and dedicated booth level management major parties the main reason for increased turnout aap ridiculed because its impatience nautanki hypocrisy inexperience above all the nauseating self righteousness when they are actually cut from the same cloth the rest same caste religion and criminal politics dont argue this enough links have been posted with aap politicians indulging all these except few brainwashed and few idealists one actually buys the crap that aap trying cleanse politics mean when someone says wants clean politics and then takes tacit support from goons like mukthar ansari bsp etc you know they are just shitting had not accepted all poltiicians are corrupt that all institutions are damaged beyond repair and need kranti things need changed from inside constant small manner and not the jaldi badlegas which will only result egypt like chaos perhaps aap actually wants this not sure for under years need party that fuels hope focus capital building infrastructure development improving job market improving economy general providing decisive and efficient governance bjp the party for that and hence the overwhelming support for amongst this demographic years later once modi retires need not worry since bjp has awesome bench strenght and talks are already start grooming manohar parrikkar take over from modi need genuine secular left wing party play perfect complement right wing bjp inc occupies that position now aap had chance develop into sensible left wing party but their actions betray deep inexperience arrogance nauseating self righteousness and incompetence they have all but squandered the goodwill they generated lot and nothing short miracle can save them unless they change their current ways hope they sink into political oblivion because the nation cant afford second congress winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents winning what matters not the opponents realpolitik suggests the weaker the opponents the better ,1
imho aap started good party but later went sham spree lost most genuine support ,1
 going churlish and ahead and puncture your baloon one pointby one point certain that turnout this election result whole india against corruption movement even people who gave their votes bjp congress must have awakened aap some way turn out 2013 assembly elections highest ever assembly election history turn out rajasthan 2013 assembly elections highest ever state history 2013 turn out karnataka 2013 2013 despite what you might think voter turn out and interest politics amongst the young the middle class and the hitherto not interested educated masses not aap doing sure the iac movement anna hazare movement did raise lot eyeballs did the protests for nirbhaya but aap did jacksquat outside delhi heck fail get why you folks don understand core issue aap will non existent outside the ncr and maybe punjab they are non entity the south and west even the cities and the hinterland where some our population resides they are absolutely unknown but lets face aap much better opposition than inc for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still think the exit polls are absolutely horrendously over bloated towards the nda and the nda crowning not certain and aap feel will get seats and not back empty handed fingers crossed ninja edit typos spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and about the sucession plans premature though they may the bjp for all the faults non bjp supporters find with truly democratic meritocratic party and the distant future get parikkar chouhan would say they are arguably the best this country lead aside from amma but meh her corruption and arrogance will come her way ,1
agree with you some parts hope aap becomes larger and mature party the coming years but they need acknowledge learn from their mistakes start respect and admire the good work done others aap should also project same image they give impression that only they are the saviours ,1
 local government deals operational level example municipal corporation union government deals strategic policy level aap perfect for local level but their policies are too socialistic and backward for developing country should they develop superior vision will support them primary concern economy and education believe the more educated our country the better leaders will have will support aap city level every single day but they need mature and gain depth for the national level ,1

 had massive respect and high hopes for kejriwal and aam admi party until quit government delhi and jumped into elections for the reasons still can comprehend top that with his crusade against the most corrupt communal modi communalism worst than corruption development only corruption gujarat and the greatest them all muslims plz communal ,1
itt fucking immature retard making his point and someways proving truly belongs aap ,0
when would aaptards realize that aaps plan simply align with the congress officially few years ,0
every once while one the aap people post thread like this and they will get lectured why aap the worst thing ever happen india see you later the evening when this thread will buried among other things ,0
not political enthusiast but have share this aap gave ticket one the farmer loyalist area and the guy made live phone call aap leaders and their party offices asking for some monetary assistance their reply was don have any money while their leaders were enjoying huge foreign fundings after few days they stopped picking his calls ,1
you sound genuine but let give you simple answer aap not national party just fighting elections from all the seats from india doesn make you national party you actually need win them and for that you need have structure place may next decade think even bsp once fought elections from lot seats india still considered regional party well kind but you get the point ,1
 two cents for the upcoming elections results mega thread 16th saw thread which mentioned exit polls for vips such section the main thread will highly appreciated also have make rediquette enforced mean some posts should allowed here and there otherwise all the fun will lost ,1
whoa modi thanking spree thanks sponsors though ,1
all ask you modi fast internet affordable price ,1
could just just possibly that their social media account managers are truly gentlemen ,1
this not the issue concerned about what concerned about the selling away natural resources and need this for the economy attitude towards the environment don need the kind development that endangers our forests rivers and air this the issue all need talking about but the mainstream media chooses ignore this now ,1
 ananthamurthy was mistake phat gayi dont understand how someone can say will leave country someone gets elected that basically says you not believe the due process your country and dont care about how the rest your countrymen feel since are democracy there mistake here basically had said fuck you the rest the 850 million voters smarter than all you collectively now sir gtfo,0
 slightly unnerving that dissenters are being spoken treated like this very much democratic and necessary have dissenters such ananthamurthy although some the things says are crazy everyone entitled their opinion long they don force others why should anyone else care ,0
 modi victory triumph advertisements and media management said what shameless fellow modi spoke 477 rallies rahul spoke less than that and modi rallies were lot bigger average not acknowledge that hard work part nature elitists like him who sit their ass and feed themselves old glories ,0
bjp let alone nda has clear majority with wide margin fully expect them fast track all the good work and make some drastic changes this five years that will establish their ground for next years anything short this would disappointing would not have such expectations they had barely formed coalition majority ,1
 few other anti muslim innuendos few clearly you haven been following india for the past few months don think there anything worry about though mean what the worst that can happen modi the bjp can anything that goes against the constitution the court judgements even comes ram mandir issue ,0
hope they sideline issues like ban beef export cow slaughter ram mandir asylum for non indian hindus etc uniform civil code good thing though also let see what they will about the much talked about black money swiss banks direct income tax reforms measures prevent corruption police reforms judicial reforms foreign policy changes curbing illegal immigration failing act not option coz the end the term they won have any excuse they have majority their own don have worry about the coalition dharma bullshit also free from the influence jaya maya mamata ,1
this precisely why was afraid the bjp coming into power don care about 2002 but would very pissed the state becomes embroiled religion some has already happened with this thrust promoting indian values whatever the hell they might please give development and economic freedom don thrust religion culture down our throats you let the people decide who put power not let the people decide what they want read what they want watch and what values they want adopt ,1
need absolute focus development supporting farmers and industries cultural imperialism hindu values ban valentine day nonsense regulations women working late these are all issues which will the critical eye with which should watching our government ,1

 totally agree the bjp party have heard have promoted religious advancement whether purposely accident instead fixing india social reforms and poverty stricken lands believe the bjp nationalist view the right view towards aiding the country benefit the people and social development not the economy lets just hope that modi will focus less his religious aspects india and more the country health have also considered the samajwdi party for their socialist views equal india with healthcare welfare and working rights for all will surely benefit the country but looks like they are not having too much recognition but please want hear more from the people who are actually being affected this election just interested student from the states,1
lets not ak49 this new govt give years and comment ,1
dae find amusing that the same comment the top comment and the bottom comment this thread wtf going here facepalm ,1
let him make government lets see who his cabinet people were worried about all those elements before and after elections gujarat and before loksabha election bjp not even governing the the states india wants win 2019 wants get some seats and increased his voteshares kerala and will worried doesn any development work promised and wins 2019 then will back hindutva most voted for modi bjp not modi supporters 180 million indian voted for him pretty sure there are more than hard core criminals voted for modi rahul doesn mean modi rahul criminal too ,1
 religious things include ucc 370 and illegal immigration then they should certainly they can prioritize development over but they should deliver their manifesto what with people claiming they shouldn the things they stood for and got votes isn this why hate politicians that they discard their agendas and manifestos after voting certainly think they should everything that they promised long tune with the constitution they should also not things that are the polar opposite what they said they said sabka saath and sabka vikas and they should live its spirit being pluralistic also ,0
 can really understand why keep getting these submissions from what appear first time voters rss the ideological mentor the bjp both abv and namo were former pracharaks rss has influenced and shaped the way they and most their would ministers think why should the bjp disown its ideology just please section the college going first job junta the voted for modi but not cool with the rss bjp better stay away from them else vote will aap next time crowd while one wants modi give any importance the lunatics the sangh parivar expecting him the bjp stay away from their ideological mentor stupid voting for the left and making submissions about karat staying away from socialism the bjp has put emphasis development and that where their focus should but issues like the ram mandir should way forgotten just because handful first time voters want edit don forget construction ram temple also part pre poll promise and lot people would want see that happen not because don have enough temples india but because will the logical conclusion the movement that for the first time asserted hindu nationalism the temple about restoring the lost pride not very different from construction somnath temple post independence the razing the mosque was sad event but when plea hundred years falls deaf ears frenzy takes over ,1
 received automatic message from namo handle thank you for your wishes and link namo having good team,1
 astonishing victory ,1

really wonderful speech came from the heart ,1
wtf was the content guys stuck work and some dumbass meeting whatsapp groups are all ablaze with this ,0
same here man revealed the statesman side him what was revealing most was inspite his trenchant criticism congress right through the campaign had the grace acknowledge that every govt has tried its level best good for the country and that should forget negativity move forward with hope his speech revealed sense mission and clarity that were desperately missing these many years feel good man and bjp supporter feels especially emotional now the challenge before bjp and modi convert this mandate into permanent mandate based governance ,1
why modi why were only taught hate politics and politicians now don change that ,0
the fact that cares means much always been cynical about politicians but modiji has made feel hopeful about our country for that shall always grateful the next decade will very interesting indeed good times ahead ,1
mildly interesting the calendar 2014 same the calendar 1947 year 1947 once again ruler european origin has been forced abdicate the throne due the movement led gujarati ,1
after years poker face from was fresh change see that actually cares ,1
 maybe just jaded but sounded like any political speech you expect from someone who describes himself nationalist lots patriotism and talk about future hope for the country attended speech given him before and very good orator this fine speech but hardly something that makes you shed tears perhaps the effect profound because his predecessor was someone incredibly ineffectual and passive ,1
"where the healthy disrespect for authority which the foundation democracy have stumbled some rss fan page this what reddit like see dark clouds fatal
now let crouch into fetal position and wait for the blows ",1
 feel have all gone over board this mass hysteria history has shown when ever people have god like saviors out their leaders they have failed ,0

 captain can get you fired emotionally and mentally troops will follow him into the trenches the deepest trenches this country cares after long long time ,0

wow never knew randia was full emo crybabies modi tum logon chacha lagta hai kya ,1
 serious question all who support bjp modi will you change your opinion when the rss starts dictating what being indian not saying they will but suppose they start saying english music must banned our some shit like that maybe how women should dress what will you then have had some experience with those guys that why fear these kind situations will happen you can not take the effort putting your self this hypothetical situation don bother answering ,1
how did you manage convince some voters vote for bjp case they were not happy with their bjp candidate what kind arguments were provided ,1
watching the library right now tears rolling down face ,1
thanks lot helping modi become our best hope right now ,1
 you see any difference the vision you see any difference the expectations which the people who you reached out and modi stated plan vision are there cases which the youth you talked wanted modi focus more issues they raised which not part modi agenda ,1
 was nice speech enjoyed though did seem filmy some sections ,1
 things continue like this for the next five years think namo napkins will very profitable biznesh ,1
 jizzed everywhere everywhere now feel drained and weak perhaps have cup tea and lie down for while hope can get again the time modiji reaches the venue his next speech ,0
for the best part was where talked about the poor man said met guy who had single piece clothing his body came with hope everybody should keep him mind while doing their jobs ,1
 india has huge hard for modi hope you all live see the day when the modi administration will block reddit even worse gonewild censor movies ban internet porn start online witch hunt for bloggers arrest twitter users for hate speech try journalists and academics trumped sedition charges you all will get the comeuppance for cheering him the best case scenario will only the form censorship and curtailment civil liberties and not trishul carrying murderous mobs the street ,0
what you think about aap and social media campaign ,1
 cried looks like gave him some release wish him all the best ,1
 thanks for ama how you the team gets paid ,1
 serious when you say social media does that include creating fake accounts different social media sites and defending modi know may come out offensive some but all know that creating fake accounts thing this world and done lot agencies and that modi all people had the strongest team india had ever witnessed particularly the time surrounding the elections ,0
there were multiple groups supporting modi prime ministerial candidature facebook which ones did you work and also what did you before management consulting ,1
 curious about the source funds for the bjp not seen them reveal their sources and assume the staggering campaign would have needed lot money could you elaborate this ,1
 how big was the team did you help pulling data about polling population mix reports etc too whom did you report how were the meeting spots chosen random any specific reason ,0
hey thanks for doing this ama have two questions did you get chance personally meet modi what your personal opinion our country upcoming ,1
any particularly memorable incidence the campaign ,1
what activities did you engage raise funds you had make estimate the total amount money spent bjps campaign what would that estimate ,0
thanks for doing the amaa few questions how did you build your email database what was that motivated you volunteer ask this you took sabbatical which presume was almost year long would the government use the data and feedback that you have acquired over the course your work how continuation would the current government continue leveraging your group gauge public opinion over the next five years ,0
 probably late this but how much the negative propaganda you really believe the propaganda against aap naxalite organization congress team both obviously claims that somehow people lapped these obviously originated the bjp think tanks and were large part the social media anti campaign coming from behind the scenes did you really believe what you were sharing was just win hook crook ,1
just comment looking this ama clear that the campaign was one the most efficient technology based and well run the history india and for that matter the world believe huge cadre intelligent folks tune with the pulse the world contributed however should not forget that namo and the higher brass the organization were willing incorporate the advice well this especially important very skeptical that different candidate such sushma swaraj would had been able pull off something like this really hope that this approach now used governance management and all other aspects our new govt would really like congratulate you and others job well done and hope that this just the beginning ,1
did your work involve actively whitewashing narendra modi involvement the gujrat riots and the incident general referring sites like this http www gujaratriots com total crap ,0
listen the key point here keep the campaign after the elections the presstitutes and congi social media folks will still out there trying discredit modi need active post campaign media management keep winning ,1
 the hindsight there anything you would have done differently handling social media are you satisfied with the results ,1
thank you much for doing the ama and congratulations your recent victory other than seeing that modi being successful his campaign can you tell frankly about young adults opinions regarding modi during the campaign was modi able connect well with the young generation what was the key component here when interacting with young people the social media ,1

congrats your victory only you behind this account there team involved this amaa too your org should seek sigma ,0
caste based population counting was done 2011 was this data available your organisation promote bjp ,1

welcome india and thanks for ama question when did you bjp start reaching people through social media campaign what was the one most succesful move strategy that made the campaign succesful out curiousity how old are you and what are your qualifications especially terms running campaigns and strategising ,1
several times felt that more could have been done for the campaign there some forum any other place where people can contribute ideas and suggestions ,1
 you have any personal views that contradict those bjp modi yes did impact your work this with regards the stringent stand the rss against western evils like homosexuality and live relationships ,1

 the organisation centre for accountable governance you mentioned about analytics can you please elaborate this how and what kind data was gathered what analysis was done did bjp modi campaign take any their decisions based your research and analytics did you only work for the modi campaign whole did you also work specific seats and constituencies you see the future elections being decided social media and perceptions that are formed sites such twitter toi comments section what kind fundraising you you give receipts for the money collected thanks ,1

whenever people change name place they destroy history don agree with bombay called mumbai madras called chennai our future generations won even know that were was such place called madras calcutta and especially oppose renaming because these cities were made foreigners themselves although don really mind allahabad called prayag because muslims didn made allahabad they simply renamed however mind hindus change name bhopal bhojpal some people want because bhopal city was founded afghan mercenary whoever founds the city have the right name and people rename then they are culprits destroying historical relic ,1

 fully support this initiative can this nationwide scale one shot change the names say 000 cities and 000 roads one shot that would fun come swamy where your ambition alternatively rename them names from least 000 years back refer old texts myths ,1

this guy makes sense sometimes but also says the most retarded things whole bunch times people like names which they are familiar though changing names under british india wasn bad enough after years actually suggesting the changing names which are many hundreds years old this kind tokenism much worse than the kind congress stood for ,1
these touchy religious nutbags again how about focus some real issues for change instead majority appeasement ,1

 honestly don see the issue here more comfortable speaking hindi decided conversing hindi from here modi orator english where close modi orator hindi ,1
what does this mean for potential modi ama will allowed speak hindi ,0
why this such hot topic debate modi more comfortable hindi gujarati then has every right use should merkel always uses german and putin always uses russian etc why should modi use english ,1
thats good has very strong command the hindi language hearing some our politicians speak english makes cringe because their poor grasp causes the impact their message lost let the translators their job ,1
 ammal was director kalaignar fulfill legal requirements the company and she does not know any language except tamil her counsel told the court addition shanmugasundaram said she can recognise anybody except close relatives and that she years old and needs medical attention health grounds won oppose the bail application moved dayalu ammal said the public prosecutor lalit however opposed the bail pleas all the other nine people accused the money laundering case including raja and kanimozhi dmk rajya sabha and minority shareholder kalaignar ,1
not opposing bail not the same dropping investigations everyone but the most dangerous criminals are entitled bail dayalu ammal not active politician business woman she just someone propped director meet govt requirements this very common thing all companies since until last year you needed directors shareholders for private limited company you wanted start business and doing all the hard work for why would you want give away shares stranger you just get your wife mother daughter etc some other family member you trust will not act against you the other shareholder directory makes more sense for woman because they get better tax breaks and also the misogynistic reason that they are under someone control wah modi modi runs the executive branch the government the judiciary courts are not and will never under his control the courts grant bail not even the govt prosecutor agrees the bail the judge can refuse and the judge can deny bail even the govt prosecutor demands otherwise ,0
 think this because many the accusations made earlier had evidence back results wild imagination fueled prospect gaining political capital maligning the opponent secondly there another issue that often these allegedly corrupt guys hid their tracks well ,1
maybe because aap lok sabha candidate from hisar yudhvir singh khayalia gave him clean chit ,1
that handicapped prof deserved every bit legal hurt that came his way for the things accused doing colour not bothered ,1
did you not get the part where says she years old and needs medical attention ,1
parties don act the law does give them their due process the parties government should speed yes but there some more important shit atm ,1
because they that vadra the congress will the same them when they come into power and you have retarded believe the congress won come back power eventually there implicit agreement between political parties that because every politician has some skeletons his closet the degree varies but every politician corrupt the very nature the game attracts certain kind player they bite vadra right now the congress will come back bite them ,0
karunanithi wife severely suffering from some brain related disease she having some memory loss and hence her prosecutor appealed the court acquit her the case hate dmk but this fair she genuinely suffering but kanimozhi karuna daughter and raza are being undergoing trial cbi special court ,1
they have already said the law will take its own course and there will personal vendetta against any1 and the investigation already underway rajasthan ,1
there personal vendetta and the law taking its course the more they talk about know media will say vendetta over development and the true faces and colours are showing and all that nonsense what not personal vendetta was quite rightly election issue have idea why you confuse these two people india had reminded about damaad shri especially the time elections and that what bjp did looks like you want namo not allow the law take its own course and make this priority then modi above the law headline waiting which will followed the evil dictator reference seen enough will the right thing your efforts equate nda with upa downright silly ,1
 would say that congress has used the cbi create incriminating files all opposition members probably same with bjp the same way how and bsp hate each other yet have done nothing against each other when they come power ,0
suppose bjp starts acting against them what you think will happen let give you the idea everyday there will news how bjp leaders are more corrupt and with full proof evidence which might put bjp lot more trouble ,1
 may soon the mandate was out let all expectations investigations coalgate cwg they have made video vadra but they cannot even file fir and guess what the gas prices are very likely the same shit chaddi gang chides kejriwal for actually going happen cms,0

 india federal structure modi will have work with several congress and their cronies like cms several people like shourie have repeatedly said that must take them the cms partners otherwise his development efforts will not bear fruit the cms will simply put their foot down and refuse operate subsequently the centre may start harassing them which will further ensure deadlock what you imagine will happen congress ruled states modi goes after vadra guns blazing cannot your face confrontation will the rajmata allow cms give red carpet welcome modi brazenly goes after her family has lot more subtle consider the control she has the party someone has already given news link the launched investigations rajasthan govt this cannot aap fantasised tamasha real world does not operate black and white ,1
bjp won touch vadra vadra didn about his land acquisition spree himself you need others play their part too the reason why bjp won investigate and out corruption congress they congress will out the corrupt amongst the bjp yes bjp and congress are the same sides the dirty coin and they will hold each other ransom using bjp fanboys will never admit that ,0
why pick just this there are many issues dealt with going take time,1
what did you expect them put every corrupt person jail the day they were sworn are you naive ,0

 too cynical think that the political class will not after one their own when party power will cry hoarse about member being corrupt criminal etc when comes power they keep mum about and vice versa afaik was only tamil nadu that this pattern was broken jayalalitha and karunadhi went after each other when they were each power ,0
 was just one comment uma bharati during campaigning bjp clearly said there will witch hunting and law will take its course modi not kejriwal make career out witch hunting ,1
first all gandhis are really really powerful even though they are not power they have people all over administration any direct attack gandhis will have have dire consequences even kejriwal rarely takes names rahul and sonia gandhi for those you who dont know bjp more corrupt than congress congress knows its way around the system most their deals doesn leave any trace money factor for govt makes money giving free hand gunda elements and they want fixed return per week city its thats why gunda friendly congress follows the official route just reverse thats why govt sops bjp doesnt have luxury use this route they directly deal with corporates thats why business friendly aap not even equation national let them prove themselves then should compare with bjp congi why govt silent vadra party power have act responsibly not saying they will ever will but even they acted against gandhis vadra they have really sure about themselves nobody voted for modi take revenge gandhis even they fulfilled promises mere yaar agli baar bhi modi sarkaar rajkumar voice hum who hai 2002 modi wait kar rahe hai jani,1
 wait wait weren people all against aap yesterday for spewing venom against gadkari without evidence isn this the same thing wait course not the bjp can never wrong ,1

 south indian who grew delhi entire life here the thing don understand the need for indians get snobbish about their languages when south indians need stay hindi speaking state they have learn hindi for better communication with people and the same applies people from other states staying the south you gotta learn kannada you stay karnataka people won learn languages for you any place hate the english worshipping that goes for reason always becomes attack hindi hate that don have unifying language maybe like indonesia could have developed new language with elements from all languages around the country there denying language unifies people its just not true india have too many languages and too many people who speak those languages the writer seems south indian his name all saying that there nothing wrong modi speak hindi what wrong why should not speak hindi comfortable what with the love english english spoken much lesser people than hindi the argument alienating people invalid there can multiple translators working translate what says one forcing any language down your throat either fact english has been much more forced school where teachers forced speak english college where see many bright people struggling only because they are being forced things language they are not comfortable just saying obviously they will have learn forcing language someone would say english being forced much more than any other when want gift grandmother smartphone can why because languages like swahili and polish find place the settings but not hindi tamil telugu any other its collective failure that have raised english pedestal and kicked our own languages the ground ,1
 main ghanta waalon nahi sunne waala aap batao saath main unki batti gul karte hain modi putin and chinese premier now try saying that english ,1
great way close india off from the rest the world ,1
 love english and use most the time but the same time also love indian languages trying learn urdu script there shouldn language based bias society though person who knows little english considered better than person who much intelligent and have rich vocabulary hindi words sad truth ,1
 think there nothing wrong using vernacular language however there nothing specifically right about given the diversity within india and there nothing wrong but very practical with using english which has universal appeal both within india arguably not much among the illiterates and outside edit fixed some typos,0
perhaps islam and arabic would more appropriate ,1
 other country uses alien language medium for higher education example look china korea japan european countries etc should know english well questioning this but need use native language primary communication medium ensure that masses are getting exposed scientific learning which hindered english the moment ,1
that terrible article say that language will help cultural reawakening slippery slope argument culture not something that static our culture has been evolving over the last century just has been over the last millennium mixes and matches with everything comes across and this mixing and matching very much integral part any evolution say not doing right and that should start over again just plain stupid can speak english and just indian the whole idea decolonisation just pandering nationalistic sentiments and picking examples memes and expressions language saying they not culturally relevant just rubbish the author had read the story ganesha ganesh chaturthi would have come across the expression elephant headed like culturally lost use that phrase including the depiction attaching the head onto body read any decent english literature wouldn feel squirmy inside the idea corpse nailed cross can imagine where drew these examples and can cross fingers anymore give fucking break misses the point completely culture formed ideas and language simply meant for communicating these ideas when you get down the fundamentals all just the ideas that matter you can have the same culture yet speak different languages ,0
wtf english has grown much beyond the itsy bitsy history that you associate with colonialism wake the fuck not you like living the 19th century each his own guess ,0
 agree with this article but all languages come from sanskrit and sanskrit was brought iranians can speak the languages related the oppressors also hindi influenced from persian and many other oppressor languages think should only communicate sign language that the only way completely decolonize our mind although not communicating all would better which can also solve the biggest problem that hindus face the oppression different views but can afforded but not the international sign language because developed west which oppresses need develop our own sign language ,1
its all beginning modi evil plan making gujrati national language india ,0
 hope this decision also includes plan have enough textbooks various subjects least acceptable quality published various indian languages until then good luck with this plan ,1

omg stop supporting english this subreddit can have the mods wake and approve just the posts hindi and other regional languages don need decolonize these minds why the hypocrisy ,1

one great advantage can crap all want hindi and claim being mistranslated later watched the bhutan speech dude gives extempore there good chance could make mistakes conversation but yeah translators can handle ,1
what caught eye was his pointing out the application the term sacred history semitic faiths and myth non semitic faiths including course hinduism amused because ‘sacred history’ deliciously creative euphemism for ‘christian mythology’ concrete and real sounding the word ‘mythology’ have noticed over time reserved anglophones for any non semitic stories greek norse hindu buddhist roman etc whereas when comes time describing their own mythology anglophones use ‘scripture’ and never ‘mythology’ but think ‘sacred history’ even better implying there ‘real’ history and then ‘sacred’ history which true there history and then there myth and ends thus with exceptions like amitabh ghosh’ ‘the shadow lines’ the entire corpus indo anglian literature leaves little cold like making love through interpreter ,1
the biggest problem with hindi any regional language compared english that thry dont evolve live the computer age how many know the hindi any regional language words for computer the internet now compare this german arabic the moment something comes out english are ported these languages immediately never see that any indian languages ,1
speaking language because you are comfortable one thing trying enforce people who are not comfortable trying reduce the influence language many find comfort the name decolonialisation just needless kulcha dick waving that said agree with some points this article the western bias against indian culture and the way approached something that quaint but primitive irritant but the author pedantic about many things ranting about the economist and about how the vatican referred western predominantly christian crowd silly ,1
honestly think that that person living the south have absolutely need speak hindi when south indians the north people expect learn and speak hindi but when they come south they make attempt learn the language english common national language convenient because allows everybody converse easily ,1
great point srinivasan mother tongue isn hindi like all indians maybe and the plurality indians who aren hindi speakers should get rid hindi well while are doing well the business decolonizing ourselves ,1
modi thinking yar mujhe angrezi jyada ati nahi mai hindi bolunga firstpost brilliant plan modiji decolonize our colonial mindset bla bla bla ,1
 further evidence that the age the unquestioned kowtowing foreign tongues coming end vive difference the french might say lol,1
 the fact that prime minister narendra modi has decided speak hindi with his foreign visitors clear statement principle there need apologise for indian ness nor there the need consider english the all and end all what bullshit was making such statement modi english shit and would embarrassing for him struggle through interviews and speeches makes sense for him speak only hindi ,0

the problem with muslims they think they are more closely related middle east than india ,1
maybe that because the people protesting against the gaza occupation are the same class muslims who attacked the train godhra vandalized the war memorial mumbai don expect much protesting from them against the actions their own kind ,1
you internet warrior you are only speaking mirrors over here say what you said the street you have the balls call muslims out india lost cause irrespective muslims plus the one thing common how muslims behave across the world its not problem centralised india ideological change required which islam heavily insulated against its only going decades education make them not care about religion much ,0
 favor look the banner this subreddit now look your words your words match with the spirit this subreddit can you not understand that muslims are large group people and they not all act and think the same but when you lump them together they then you are the one causing problems you think you not have any prejudice against muslims all that these are truly words you believe you will able live with muslims alongside you brothers don think you are going judge every muslim you see based these things you written above which many them have nothing with then how can you expect peace and civility among and with them why surprising that muslims are sometimes violent agitators and sometimes victims violence just hindus are islam and hinduism deal with violence and they deal with peace because they are religions for people and people are violent and people are peaceful your post isn enlightening anyone all you are doing spreading hate towards people you not know there are peaceful muslims and violent ones and there are peaceful bjp members and violent ones parties and religions and groups are all made people and you not account for that diversity then you will never able deal with other kinds people there are mullahs who speak against violence the bohra syedna one can think and there are mullahs who provoke just like there are politicians who speak against violence and those who promote cannot have outrage all the time there isn enough time each day outrage over every bad person the world but for every bad action there are some who are outraged regardless religion any other silly grouping factor again look your words look the banner this subreddit does this post belong here ,0
wow such deluded hate the anti muslim brigade could maybe spread little love around than cherry picking and spreading lies and hate maybe you should talk about how islam encourages charity and compassion wait they don pay for that they and remember when you generalize 8bn sect the basis small group amongst them you are better than the called muslims who spread violence and hatred you just following their footsteps and claim have higher moral ground ,0
 tired this bullshit let assume that you are right and take this statement not believe that muslims are minority india they are not minority they are the second largest majority this minority image political stunt gain votes plain and simple then again indian muslims are not one homogeneous block they have sects taken whole they are not minority islam violent fascist cult whose goal convert many people possible tolerance not only absent seen weakness that can taken advantage granted there are problems with the teachings the religion evidenced many but which religion without fanatics remember that reformation like event has happened islam instead the broader muslim world seems getting caught often bloody debate about who the true muslims are you need similar case point look ulster ireland torn between catholic and protestant fanatics who are often violent isn the goal christianity too convert the maximum number people all religions can called violent fascist cults parts the christian west the religion has more elements common sense but you cannot deny that blind fanaticism still exists the problem the muslim world not helped the least the fact that modern education and science are often frowned upon add this the problem economic deprivation and you have situation where religion becomes the opium the masses whatever this religion proclaimed high priests and imams seems believe will exactly what the people will lap that said there are several muslim scholars even supposedly evil saudi arabia who have called the taliban and isis exactly what they are terrorists the attitude muslims fringe extremist elements seems one passive ignorance and hence support cannot comment this not muslim myself and hence cannot speak for the community there great deal hypocrisy among muslims when comes calling out the sins their own too find this selective outrage targeted israel strange given the fact that muslims are slaughtering other muslims iraq iran and pakistan islam the single biggest danger that india faces today and must strictly dealt with matter what takes corruption bigotry and ignorance coupled with economic deprivation are the biggest threats india today islam just religion ,0

this thread has been linked from elsewhere reddit shitredditsays believe that muslims are the perpetrators almost all the violence and civil unrest that this country faces the present times islam the single biggest danger that india faces today and must strictly dealt with matter what takes \ \ subredditdrama month old but still worthy india discussing muslims you follow any the above links respect the rules reddit and don vote comment questions abuse message here 2fr 2fmeta bot mailbag ,1
 completely agree this what been trying say here most redditors here see anti muslim comments and immediately start screaming hate without thinking that the feelings may justified due india historical and ongoing relationship with muslims yes india tolerant state and has always been one but muslims general don see tolerance something aspire emulate they see weakness exploited the path turning yet another country into islamic one see evidence this even outside india just look the actions muslims take western countries which they achieve even somewhat significant proportion the population ,1
disclaimer muslim hope you considered that you cannot blame the whole community for the action few know not few but these blood thirsty people cannot considered muslims those who kill innocents are strictly not muslims they may call themselves but are just blindly using religion excuse islam doesn approve encourage wars against non believers most these just uneducated people who have nothing please hope you change your wordings and place groupings carefully for you continue scout topper would soon degraded damn terrorist ,1
this thread looks like the last bit freedom break all the rules without abhay consequences guess time get dirty ,0
dear mods when can buy you beer will participate more and nice everyone you are actually going ban single propaganda users who type hours day good luck let make this place better place ,1
mods can have more flairs for the posts themselves the binary distinction political and non political isn very helpful ,1
thank you this was desperately needed ,0
 india social media platform share links and for thoughtful discussion this not twitter facebook share biased and unsubstantiated opinions this not your soapbox vent the title and leave empty post behind for people squabble about all self posts that have the body will removed context important self posts with incendiary titles will removed what orignial content wanted share something found deviant art this 419165014 was not the creator the content does that make copied content that case does that against the rule and hence gets banned ,1
nice more censorship yay what can say lovin ,1
freedom speech does not mean freedom asshole nice going mods ,1
 think someone needs explain reddit upvotes and downvotes the mods something upvoted the top and mods remove claiming that this propaganda way the combined sentiment india then what the meaning having upvotes and downvotes this nothing but attempt impose specific political viewpoint india bound fail mods india will join the ranks goebbels and stalin examples failed attempts force particular point view uncooperative population ,0
 ’ make sure the trolls and hate mongers stay away how will you doing this will you mark out people based your own discretion and prevent them posting comments posts making claims without any credible source are liable get flaired unverified the mods does this mean can post tweets from verified accounts and flair them accordingly ,1
 definitely need yeh kya chutiyapa hai flair thanks for the good work mod ,1
nice read this have unsubscribed from the sub while back but occasionally cone see and this was the exact reason for leaving its unbelievable how much hate people have towards each other this sub weather its based religion caste race will resub the quality really improves ,0
wow lot has changed here seems ages since was last this sub ,1
 mods all religious hatemongers should drown cow piss just kidding please don warn for this ,0
 fuck yeah more rules ,1
this monumentally political move you promote your collective mindset the rest irrespective what your motivations are this will obviously implemented with bias because lets face the mods are mostly certain political slant you are trying essentially take speech you feel offensive like secular communal offense subjective thing and also question taste and the audience the audience disagrees with the post they will exercise their opinion not need the mods sanctimonious also where was this outrage when people said should wipe out and bihar because rapes anti statements due freebies all those qualify hate speech too but did not have the equivalent indira gandhi approving editorials now did why that your sensibilities are more hurt people offending certain religion point not that one less hateful than the other but that your perception also skewed your politics this your subreddit and you can spread whatever propaganda you want but don act holier than thou about you taking offense things that the large number don evidenced the votes you truly want open and balanced make more people mods people who are not perceived being biased the current set before implementing these regressive steps ,1
 demand ban banning mods some mods have inherent hatred for users who don always agree with their view and can flip ban user without second thought even they ban later the constitutional right freedom speech has been abused those power and constitution india above india petty rules ,1
been saying this for the past fucking years and only now you realize this and then you blame policy paralysis and what not the poor govt yahan toh you sirs don even have any opposition ,0
good ,1
wah heading merimarzi interested people can join thanks but thanks india mod ,1
ugh seems indian secularism spreading from media social media considering the political orientation the mods here and the kind views they hold one them once said the godhra train burning was rss conspiracy know well which section posters and posts are going selectively moderated ,1
 with their strong language and hateful comments these radicals have kind succeeded discouraging people with opposing views even bother participating and questioning their false bigoted propaganda why don you mark your own post unverified where your data back this seems you are making stuff create more rules give preference the mods bias had said this previously and will say again india what due its community mods did not build india the users did this seems like futile attempt control discourse small group elitist mods who think they know better than the users also who says civility better you want force rules down our throat give some say who the mods should also feel that mods this sub are very homogenised thought and that going turn india into completely one sided sub like politics sooner later all the mods here seem support liberal appeasement politics and that but also need mods who not toe the liberal line blindly ,1
looks good move the way conversations usually would transpire such threads was the major reason don usually participate religious political threads hopefully the discussions become more civil now but everyone can voice their sane opinions,1
wow more types flair amazing how did one ever think this would good idea before bow this literally amazing why can mods just ban all hate mongering standard that ought shut these secular jholawallah sanghis for good jai hind ,1
why don you guys ever consult the community large what changes would like ,1
really nice you but don expect much civility here its been very annoying lately people just seem out with their keyboards looking for someone kill ,0
 insert generic change bad freedom speech argument here all seriousness think this good idea one the things always disliked about this sub unwarranted bigotry keep the great work ,1
nice going mods guess its time stop filtering political posts now ,1
just for the context this thread context most the offensive comments stand deleted just posting context the top comment was something the lines mass killing and ethnic cleansing mean there was even one user who corrected saying wasn ethnic but religious cleansing wtf does matter then plethora muslims must pakistan and such mean all for trolling troll all you want but the moment you step from harmless trolling into lel kill teh maslims then not trolling class douchebaggery reddit free speech site yes but free speech doesn mean you espouse hate and killing regularly bicker with rahulthewall and both and know harmless has never fucking lost his temper but then one you gents start calling him aapiya and what not and the discourse moves from lels don want listen you because you once wrote something favor aap really guys that fucking mature please ahead and troll all you want but don bring mass murder into discussion and please don call left right center because that fucking ruins any discussion with without lels ,1
whats wrong with letting downvotes decide what goes and what does not you first say the propaganda not combined sentiment india but then say that these hateful comments got upvoted the top which that what this group made then that what the group made all the rules shutting people will not help and what someone calls for killing all terminally ill vegetable people that hateful genocide talk the non painful killing certain parts society for some argument for good society then what can not discuss these ideas ideas like these ones why put religion some holy pedestal that cannot touched dirty hands why mods want get into the business controlling content here because you can get into legal trouble for whats posted here think the only time you should intervene when people make personal attacks one another personally but one here can assume the responsibility defending group matter how that group defined cents edit typos,0
though these new rules are bit against the concept free speech but these were required considering the kind discourse that has been happening over the past few days the mods ,1
can also regulate use flair there some bloke here that has real freedom islam free india some bigoted nonsense like that personally would love see active muslim involvement this subreddit addition the other demographics would nice peoples flair wasn uninviting india belongs the muslims too ,1
yaaaayyyyy the mods have heard have been asking for propaganda flair for some time now for posts making claims about their favorite political party without any source citations knew that the mods would like this idea ,1
seeing that all you mods are basically either aap sympathizers just plain anti bjp hindu can have couple right wingers the mod panel will defeat the whole purpose this sub ,1
 sorry putting here but the unverified twitter rule isn working seen several links unverified twitter accounts getting india front page agree that difficult moderate but having rule and not following following sporadically worse than not having the rule the first place please have look into the matter ,0
this great initiative and can think any better solution the problem hand however fear that may too much work for you the effort required manually monitoring all comments would much greater than your present workload far the sub has been moderated very well the motivation your team for essentially thankless job certainly not lacking but pretty soon will having thousand concurrent active users well guess you would have already discussed the consequences the move just hope that the everyone was board with the added responsibility you later feel that this not possible the sub can potentially brainstorm over other possible solutions though presently have none offer will certainly awesome you pull off best luck ,1
this indeed turning into stasi circle anyone the circle considered civil and normal anyone outside the circle needed beaten broken down and reset and brought into the circle when did profiling someone from comment history became rule this civil ,0
how the heck would you flair all this from mobile what about discussion posts half posts colonial india punjab israel etc would unverified how can verify thought using trigger discussion ,0
good initiative guys but what are you doing about people who get banned and are back with alt the next day spewing their bigoted crap all over again you keep track reported users ips ,0
can also please get rid comments the lines where are secular liberal right wingers chaddis etcetera ,1
good job mods ,1
fuck religion destroys everything even subreddits ,0
well all your previous rules din make much difference won hold breath ,1
can you please take tougher stand spamming there one idiot rdd who does this shit lot the name bringing imran khan back yeha you removed them once but the person back with alt ,0
 like how the mods like create more work for themselves ,1
 happy thank you mods for keeping civil and pointing our mistakes ,1
give seriously you cannot legislate morality mods are cut from the same cloth the rest the users and you simply cannot make rules that make everyone behave the way you want you adding more and more rules every month and the effect big zero lyk dis only ,1
finally thank you though not what was looking for would loved flair just for religion this hopefully step the right direction thank you again ,1
what with certain mod deleting the mere mention his favorite cricket sub reddit this sub reddit ,1
well there you the illegal bangaldeshis needed another reason stay ,0
 would awesome modi manages this but this will just part the problem the bigger challenge would make the health services accessible improve its quality just hope not exchanging notes with harsh vardhan who thinks ayurveda etc worth wasting our money ,1
 all the future docs now you will forced operations and treatments much lower than market costs abondon the field right now ,1
 commend your initiative and willingness micro moderate nothing else just one recommendation though already have the funda really need separate flair for moderated can just say that all religious discussions will marked default this will make simpler for all parties concerned lastly worry that this step becoming alarmingly like the ones taken the censor board the early 2000s there flavour know what best for you and you have choice but abide what say feel that should trust the voting system unmoderated environment get true feel what content relevant assuming most folks here are not children and extension there should need direct their actions anyway maybe you guys had different picture mind wish you and the sub all the best going forward ,1
ideally affordable health care should human right india has been spending much less than other brics nations healthcare and education and this definitely needs change fdi assisted insurance programs combined with government subsidized healthcare might way this however given how things progress india not sure this will ever become reality the opposition plans putting the insurance bill into cold storage through the rajya sabha majority not sure how the kind subsidies required implement this kind program will affordable for populous and mostly very poor country like india ,1
don already have free healthcare what are those government hospitals doing ,1
while there may multiple concerns about the economics the situation this entirely step the right direction spent internship studying the indian healthcare sector and tbh woefully under equipped mean you get only small glimpse when you see understaffed govt hospitals the reality much much worse suffice say that serious epidemic broke out today the hospitals would hard put service even the population that comes them ,0
the fuck healthcare still cheap fuck india fee government hospitals insurance will only fill the pockets insurance companies and doctors will keep raising fees the name insurance this great are not first world can least bring first world problems into our country ,1
the stupid thing about subsidy that already pay them our taxes prefer subsidy and low tax high subsidy and high tax ,0
 yeshasvini http www yeshasvini kar nic scheme karnataka proven model for workable community healthcare system may this needs scaled national level least multiple states start with ,0
 should completely free for and low cost for obc ,1
 don want health insurance much want good hospitals with doctors present them ,1
every developed nation went thro this must first get something then can tweak ,1
couldn you think more general examples rather using self otherwise what you consider people opinion ,1
short term looks like great idea long term doesnt this take towards where america today severely bloated healthcare costs because everyone has insurance and the pharma companies hospitals collect directly from the insurance companies shouldnt the answer moving towards high quality but affordable health care for all rather than insurance for all ,1
 one had good but other hand will have same situation health industry right now damn super expensive for everyone you don have health insurance you are screwed have mix response this but hope narendra modi makes sure that health industry does not turn out like health industry ,1
 this gets through will one his greatest achievements important the health insurance stays restricted only government hospitals don want become like the west where medical bills are grossly inflated solely because they are covered insurance already that way number bigger private hospitals,1
 the work few dedicated individuals using this subreddit their personal weapon seriously are mods denial that vocal majority the active participants india supports certain community its few dedicated individuals bullshit ,0
 everyone demanding something the other you haven noticed this sub ain democracy ,0
 good the idea health care for all may seem will only benefit the corporations providing health insurance health insurance for all downward spiral which leads inflation the costs medicines and medical services ultimately making health insurance unaffordable and unavoidable for the poor fudge just realized the importance functioning opposition democracy ,1
that pretty cool sure was intentional ,1
" hate that people think anything criminal seen loads videos thiefs rapists and other criminals beaten death not out self defense even your accident and the other person more injured they automatically start beating you what the fuck
who the fuck gave these people that right what the law system for angers that people behave such barbaric way other humans ",0
there doubt the writers knew about the chant they did lot research into asian culture and philosophy for this show theyre not gonna slap something because seemed cool and oriental which would frankly offensive,1
this grade observation that legitimately improved enjoyment the show thanks ,1
the generalization bollywood here nauseating salman khan movies are shit hence bollywood shit honey singh music shit hence bollywood music shit chetan bhagat books are being made into movies hence bollywood shit south movies are being remade hence there originality bollywood idiots and barfi plagiarized some scenes hence there originality bollywood pritam plagiarized tunes years ago hence there originality bollywood music bollywood actresses have done plastic surgery and have fake accent hence should hate them some actors have committed crime and gotten away hence there morality bollywood actors are rich and get publicity hence should hate them all ,0
people here are quick joke about invanted stuff sometimes there genuinely are things about our ancestors and our kulcha that can prod yes there were indian mathematicians who though the fibonacci series and pythagorian triplets way before the people whom usually attributed understand some people get anal about being proud fanatical about indian culture and history the best thing but still credit needs given where due ,1
 all fuckers take politics way too seriously when was younger mother used tell that indians talk about two things only movies and politics now don know about the former but the latter seen invade every facet internet where indians are around take chill pill for fuck sake ,0
 once got downvoted heavily this sub for saying liked the movie singh king but did there that ,1
government employees nothing other than sit their offices and sip tea ,0
one popular opinion disagree with that government and politicians are responsible for corruption india when you peruse the data the corporations which are guilty when the loss the public exchequer big while your may have diverted the mplad funds his own pocket when the corporations get involved that figure balloons lakhs crores coal gate etc edit another one indians belonging general castes are victim and the system screwing with them disagree ,1
the popular opinion that stems from lack knowledge these redditards have who downvote everything order suggest they are secular atheist above everyone think they need learn about the diff religion and dharma stop downvoting without explaination and admit they are part indian kulcha ,1
the hate for muslims saw the last few weeks ,0
 tuo shin awesome thanks ,1
 that what the low voiced chant cool ,1
what about shin what does that mean ,0
that all indian women only want falsely accuse you rape harassment dowry demands also they will only marry you order divorce you and take away half your precious property ,0
 firmly believe that employees are extremely overpaid maggi tastes like shit upa did decent job far the economy concerned our gdp growth was bound take hit due the euro crisis and global economic slowdown satire news websites like fakingnews and theunrealtimes are really lame and unoriginal too early dismiss ayurveda pseudo science sure can not replace western medicine but interesting actually take evidence based approach study ,1
 like srk think talented actor and that has played big role popularising bollywood global scale may time for him retire but still sells and makes perfect economic sense for him keep leveraging his brand but people here hate him more than hitler don get ,1
the censorship being implemented india one another form all you hypocrites hated sibal one point ,0
that nationalism and the idea unifying india one nation with one history and culture the greatest evil the world india has lot diversity and lot elements that can arouse tensions irrespective quotes like why can unite india only using the constitution nations stay together only long people want stay together pakistan case point you need something larger something that inviolable build sense brotherhood there nothing wrong trying create more united nation based shared history and shared cultural practices and values don want india only union states and loose confederation like the want india one country ,0
that isro some top class scientific organization ,1
that the mods are awful the moderation this sub midway between say for instance canada highly toxic since anything goes and canadianpolitics very heavy moderation interfering with discussions ,0
 the generally prevalent anti gandhi mohandas sentiment the generally prevalent anti nehru sentiment modi will fix india politicians are stupid the idea that india like this because bad politicians comparison the saint like citizens ,0
 wary such rules because the ones enforcing them can never fully objective and everyone even mods have biases for instance the nature the ban temp ban otherwise number warnings depends the user’ history and the kind comment question hate speech users with singular agenda will banned instantly with warnings most users here have agenda some very strong but don see any action taken most cases ,1
for long time this sub reminded the rediff comment section where every remote post about india pakistan prompted unwarranted hate towards particular community more less the same here where the ride top comment based the jasbaat rather than logic rational reasoning ,1
hate towards chetan bhagat kapil sharma infosys and bollywood movies there some shit all these but for lower and middle class folks coming from small towns includes who studied govt schools and had little access resources that average indian seem have gotten there still lot them one improves intellectually with time but imo hard catch everything that influenced one upbringing next time you see genuine person posting some nonsense facebook think about his her background she might victim all that exist printable form accurate childhood ,0
 polygamy should banned first let say that atheist and reasons for disagreement have nothing with religion but more with adult right define what marriage family means him her personally have intention marrying again but this argument extension opinion homosexual marriages every consensual adult should have the right marry whoever and however many times government has business this the problem with the current muslim personal law that only allows men and not women woman wants marry men why not men and women want cohabit together like family who stop that the only role government that see ensuring that all such marriage contracts are equal and not discriminate against anyone and that rights children such marriages are properly protected ,1
 likey honey singh music wish would ama about his career and his life choices but knowing the mentality people here sure would suffer fate worse than ,1
 that iitians suck iits mostly suck yes that aap will relevant the national politics that hinduism good religion that redditors are smarter than twitter users that heavy moderation good yes think that this the opinion which popular that nationalism bad gandhi was leftist nationalist wing nationalism and had some right ideas for india imo non violent nationalism the need the hour indians need put their country above their castes languages religions whatever that all not arguing for hindutva but this election did make indians put india first which positive development would say edit expected that wouldn get downvoted for disagreement least this thread the least you could argue instead downvoting and whining about downvote because just made account and can post without time limit now,1

 will never get the hate for arranged traditional form marriage this has been for thousands years practised all across the world the domination romance courting love marriage recent one less than 500 years your parents probably were married that way their parents were probably married that way even their great grand parents and worked for them why disagree and hate some people who not want spend time courting follow the established practice and not everyone you see going movie star understand and estimate your level before trashing the traditional marriage form and the stupid notion that once start business will able make money not really the business landscape littered with failed ventures all along ,0
 non believer ask genuine questions intended try and suggest people that elephant god could not have existed the mods consider discussion this nature hate speech well your examples were very convenient and extreme but you did not address posts this nature nonetheless hope that your protection religious sentiments does not marginalize from preaching beliefs lack thereof else truth this subreddit simply club for the religious ,0
 maybe they just put because sounds cool and oriental nope the director commentary the beginnings pt1 episode season they explained that one the guys bryke maybe forgot took class some kind percussion based oriental orchestra and then went into the point performing live and stuff forgot what was called had never heard but apparently amazing and recording ever even holds candle hearing live need listen that commentary again they talk about much ,1

 really happy see india taking more serious turn thank you mods ,1
irrespective the speech the reality the kids are not taught the right things parents plus there are empty boxes kept where can see most the people have dumped things remember even recent football world cup was japanese who cleaned the stadiums,1
this because most the times the cleaners belong lower caste and insulated our selves their misery the bottom line such work dirty sub human maid domestic servant will won modi serious about cleanliness make students clean toilets school everything will fall right place ,1
within minutes sad ,0
how ironic that the exact moment reading this the guy sitting next the marta station spits the ground not sure why adding this comment ,1
like lot comments have said this deeply rooted problem that needs massive change attitude fixed love india but visiting china you know what stood out immediately the fact that there isn fucking garbage and filth strewn around all over the place drainage canals everywhere with smell that would home described dante inferno god damn actual trash and recycling cans the streets lot fewer people feel with throwing their shit the ground think one india biggest problems along with pollution general and depressing how accepting the situation many seem course china one the world worst polluters but least they investing much solar there are million problems with authoritarian government like china but least able take care something like this when decides india government all talk see anything actually happens but guessing the same street corners will being used makeshift landfills years ,0
everyone wants everyone else cleap their country one owns ,1
anyone here from surat have they kept the city clean since the plague 1990s maybe rest the country can learn from their experience ,1
 lived india and went canada study huge country and doesn have toilets everywhere and not even trash cans people just keep trash car wait pee when they reach home reason they want indian friends once stop the car and peeped public reason they want you have desire you don need dust bin ,1
just expected feel good moment for all followed the usual routine ,1
and then was met swarm journalists asking you not like india you are saying india not good country ,0
“ want ask parents when your daughter turns years old you ask ‘where are you going when will you return ’ the parents dare ask their sons ‘where are you going why are you going who are your friends ’ after all the rapist also someone’ son only parents decide put many restrictions their sons they their own daughters ” glad that the attempting create discourse that moving away from simply blaming the victim which has had disastrous results this point time especially the more rural communities ,1
whoa good news from worldnews ,1
the speech really well done modi great speaker and the speech wasn written beforehand either was extempore couple days sure there will some english subs out highly recommend you watch you interested the topic ,1
the guy has great optimism and arguably the greatest mass leader the present era really hope can follow what has said all those speeches ,1
 article summary the biggest speech the year and his first major address indian prime minister narendra modi chose speak length about the scourge rape and violence against women breaking long silence the matter and raising the issue major prominence modi changed that with his speech friday india’ independence day given without script notes next year when stand here every school should have toilets for girls and boys ” modi challenged the government and corporations alike bot this not replacement for reading the original article learn how works bit news html ,1
 the international outrage over the 2012 delhi bus gang rape murder not mention several other subsequent high profile incidents didn raise the issue rape major prominence within india not sarcastic question genuinely curious ,0
young ragpicker continues clean litter while india whines online about how indians like talk lot about stuff ,1
the other day was going when banana peel hit windscreen which came from audi indians might have money but they don have manners and desire keep clean environment ,1
need drastic change mindset but how about having more trash cans the site ,1
 don see any waste receptacles the picture the guy who cleaning looks like using spare box this kinda thing tends happen everywhere there aren garbage recycle can provided the event holders ,0
can please get source for this how know modi was speaking here and that students were responsible for littering not that matters much litter litter but still… ,1
what the problem the place getting cleaned the place had been left dirty people could have cause for complaint large crowds people are like this the world over have been several music festivals sports events and concerts all over the globe sometimes patron and sometimes cleaner would take offence the the child labour and low wage rates would take offence the lack gloves viz vest filter mask and proper disposal methods the actual act cleaning should give noone offence ,0
interesting hear this coming from modi right wing hindu nationalist ,1
umm don want shit your thread but not really cleaning the ragpicker picking plastic bottles only can sell and make some money still good but not exactly doing what you think doing edit just read all the comments people are going gaga over how noble typical indian mentality finding something feel good about when there nothing special going ,1
 requires huge shift the mindset instill these habits the youngsters besides the youngsters their parents themselves need imbibe such habits such things should taught both home and school punitive measures such fines may not have the desired impact ,1
there should ban movies books comics music pubs drugs porn guthkha etc etc free country you know what fucking needs ban plastic there should zero tolerance for this ,0
good dude,1
this problem can fixed only with heavy fines and punishment create special police force only for fining litterers and that force will funded from the fines ,1
when modi asked for people participation keep the nation clean meant exactly this perhaps should have spelt out these dumbass kids whose parents never taught them clean their litter after them few years ago had opportunity talk reporter from the hindu who told story sometimes the president india likes address the reporters press room casual manner the rashtrapathi bhavan and always there are refreshments and such provided the journalists when abdul kalam was the president had one such event went for about minutes and they were about wind kalam had noticed that there were couple coffee cups plates strewn around lying the floor near the journalists chairs promptly asked all the journos clean behind them and added you see was teacher first and will always one think this class exercise and realize that there nothing demeaning about cleaning after oneself should also add that sometimes people not know exactly how they can contribute when you ask for people participation keep our country clean some may not know how contribute and many may not even realize the effects their actions how plastic bags are strewn around this picture give them solid task and you can expect them think duty modi could have just asked our indian citizens present there today clean after themselves what little extent they can and then perhaps these kids might have got teach kids values give people specifics about how contribute also anecdote involving abdul kalam when was the president ,1
how nobody pointing out that modi well known fascist who endorsed and encouraged genocidal mobs against muslims the gujarat riots listen someone who has gone through sexual violence course want world leaders speak the issue but not world leaders that facilitate genocide sorry but the selective praise here really disturbing ,0
"wow
amazing ",1

 would love see punisher type movie set place like india where part the population grossly mistreated and where the general consensus ignore then comes some hero fuck the rapist murders and hate mongers that are destroying peoples lives like boondock saints but they recite prayers hindi some god vengance,0
the proof the pudding statements are great but concrete actions are better ,1

 “ want ask parents when your daughter turns years old you ask ‘where are you going when will you return ’ the parents dare ask their sons ‘where are you going why are you going who are your friends ’ after all the rapist also someone’ son only parents decide put many restrictions their sons they their own daughters ” think worth noting that has made choice here girls are restricted and boys are not chooses promote the restriction boys addition the current restrictions girls rather than promote the idea that girls should unrestricted boys know major source tension between east and west conservative and liberal the amount freedoms women are allowed civil society bikinis burkhas far charting paths for nation following through his campaign promises the conservative voters that ushered him into power return values stronger national image personally glad used his first speech speak against this behavior and not saying wrong position himself conservative social reformer but certainly worth noting see his party start implement actual policy the days ahead ,1
whether this opportunist public relations genuine call action huge relief actually hear this being said out loud prime minister that alone huge step the right direction ,1
although good hear indian actively addressing the issue rape and violence against women indian society think that more should done towards educating indian men not rape and not sexually objectify women ,1
sounds awesome just hope doesn turn out india hopey changey guy ,1
glad hear tired reading about the horrible things happening india ,0
narendra modi has also wished everyone happy independence day via text message also urged everyone good deeds ,1
how seriously would you take word someone speaking against rape when has cabinet minister his government accused rape and under investigation html modi known for his speeches really good but when comes action has very little show for ,1
well rape stems from the people wanting enforce their dominance over others would impossible eradicated when their belief system allow the people believe that some were born lesser than others ,0
meanwhile the congress party spokesman busy calling rape and sanitation pedestrian issues and the did not rise the occasion ,1
fuck yeah you girl ,0
for the sake argument let assume modi was complicit the massacre hasn then rectified that ensuring peaceful gujarat this day that what leaders are made the opposition had seen modi coming ages ago and what more than stoking communal passions keep the person check thankfully tables did turn and have able for the country ,1
wow how human him,1
great now americans could have leader who would recognize and work solve our facto but yet unaddressed problems ,1
finally indian born and raised america never understood why india never addressed this head when spoke about these occurences relatives months ago their responses all circled the position not letting their daughters out all that was the mindset not only relatives but many politicians well the mindset needed change starting from the top modi ran efficient and amazing campaign for his position which resulted his landslide victory but attack this issue early his term good hear was truly scared for india country where such grotesque events were norm props modi ,1
this bigmouth guy was indian state gujarat for years and see the achievements fact sheet that explodes myths about gujarat development open toilet shame 000 people gujarats business capital defecate open html ,0
 these indians rape because they believe they have right treat woman object due lack education mostly because they believe males can act they see fit while women must know their place with that many people raping has cultural thing mean gang rapes seriously what the percentage gang raped compared 1v1 rape ,1
 would easier believe modi rhetoric weren abusing his power save rape enablers from his own base course maybe doesn count when the victim not hindu two weeks ago courts the prime minister home state where was chief minister for more than decade and where his party and clique dominate politics let maya kodnani out bail ece ,1
americas rape statistics aren much better ,1
 confused after asking previous thread why indian culture has such problem with rape was told bunch reddit sociologists that there particular problem with the indian culture and were just hearing lot about some particularly bad stories massive upvotes were had many maybe this should think about consulting with the experts here reddit before makes any further reckless statements about indian culture ,0
does anyone else feel like this ridiculous the vatican denies priest molestation for long when the new pope finally steps forward and says that not right supposed along with now the first indian leader wants address problem that plagued india for while and were just supposed say now gets fuck that the common people have been taken advantage for too long time demanded the same human rights that given all mankind not just the american canadian european arabian rich and influential and whoever else thinks themselves too good part the human race ,1
 needs talk about real issues india rapists gonn rape regardless,1
stupid war criminal giving speech about the scourge rape and violence ,0
 thanks the empty rhetoric this far right bigoted theocrat about impressive shit this the same bobble headed idiocy that made the current pope inexplicable reddit celebrity ,1
what long silence hear about rape india all the time and not even india ,0
that fucking modi,0
 gujrati this makes smile ,1
well can know the individual kids involved but can find out the schools these kids and shame them the schools the internet and other media into volunteering their students into clean drives around their neighborhoods armchair redditor that the best can this particular case ,1
why would only major prominence now everyone knows about ,1
 really hope this doesn get buried but few army buddies and myself have began put together non profit organization that would deal specifically with combating the rape epidemic plaguing india all wouldn mind just checking out our site and see anything worth your while all don mind hearing more have multimedia campaign and variety different approaches self defense that will only decrease the amount crimes like rape assault and robberies this account was created bit spontaneously but all want with questions about sponsorship job opportunities right ahead ,1
another less emphasized part this article modi also used his speech speak out against the practice indian family’ selectively aborting females the woman abandoning female babies once they’ born earlier this week the indian government announced that the sex ration among children — standing 927 girl children per 000 boys — the lowest ’ been since india’ independence 1947 ,0
 not everyone was pleased with modi’ speech however members the indian national congress were less than impressed with the scope modi offered overall his speech “given that was the first address the new prime minister one would have expected certain vision articulated him the trajectory the next five years ” party spokesperson and former minister manish tewari said “but unfortunate that got bogged down pedestrian issues without being able rise the occasion ” pedestrian issues what does tewari consider not pedestrian issue this pedestrian ,1
yeah one was talking about rape until heard this brave speech ,1
maybe part the problem the very high rates female infanticide india the selective abortion female fetuses that been going for the last years maybe the men are rapey because there actual shortage women and maybe the whole dialogue needs include the entire spectrum indian attitudes towards women from dowries class systems sex and better law enforcement for crimes against women ,1
good move modi ,1
 glad live culture where rape culture unthinkable and hard comprehend ,1
fuck yes about time not moment too soon you have sword anybody who wants scream censorship should read this ,0

lol,1
 dont think one cannot expect him understand neither scientist nor doc have engineers who believe homeopathy why single narendra out for very common our country ,0
how disappointing homeopathy load bullshit not surprised though growing always heard parents and relatives talk about and just thought was medicine wasn later until looked and realized how much bullshit ,0
 one step forward and two steps back you cant cure cancer with just placebo you know this just sad ,0
 well that let down against modi for this ,0
 think this just symptom much larger problem with indian society most not all will probably have least one friend family member who believes homeopathy india lot educated people including people scientific background believe not surprising that our believes legitimate what necessary that such contested beliefs should not affect policy for instance homeopathy should not promoted officially the government for anything more than minor incurable ailments where application homeopathy placebo theory will not cause any harm ,0
one the basic tenets this science called homeopathy about dilution leads direct contradiction with basic results chemistry not surprising therefore that the scientific community considers quackery the same time heard from many different sources that homeopathic medicine itself has helped cure diseases like chronic allergies asthma etc ,1
 not really fazed this news most our people believe our govt bestowed one the highest honors the nation homeopath why should surprised that our new believes ,1
 believe lot farce things this isnt new for example the whole world believes god and one gives damn but some one believed homeopathy and everyone goes crazy edit woah whatsup with the down votes guys wanna know you believe god the homeopathy ,0
 homeopathy farce did not know that earlier until saw this explanation bwe1th93g9u ,0
homeo not farce one relatives getting treated for schizophrenia the medicine being administered him without his knowledge long story effects the illness amazing control his schizophrenia and outbursts absolutely side effects doctor had said that year they can cure permanently not placebo patient does not even know ,1
 there should not question conflict between allopathy ayurveda and homeopathy all the three systems treatment have some best things them said chief minister said that homeopathic medicines prove very effective the case teething children seen that the irritating teething process makes children extremely weak and malnourished would great service the homeopathy can used for keeping strong the immune system child during teething process and thus preventing children from malnutrition regarding this appealed homeopathy association launch drive for curbing malnutrition some context would good its not like anti modern science unlike our kulcha who anti alternate medicine alternate medicine working for some who are force them stop using whatever happened freedom choice only applicable when suits our ideological propaganda ,1
 think homeopathy doesn hurt sure has some benefits but cannot replace medicine homeopathy probably does have long term benefits should encouraged because very economical for india and has side effects why not ,1
you guys are really crazy someone who has tremendously benefitted from homeopathy with modi this one ,0
ayurved stupid and false modi rss vhp bjp and all right wingers are stupid and don know anything people who got ayurved treatment and survived are wrong jhollawallahs modi upvotez plz ,0
really what else can inaugurating conference you cant expect him tell homeopathy all lies front all that crowd also don forget homeopathy still lucrative business html india ,1
btw why govt run many homeopathy medical colleges farce ,1
 bajpai had earlier confirmed that issues ‘love jihad’ and religious conversion hindu girls would included the political agenda the meeting however the party dropped the plan sources said after the indian express carried story its august edition this regard the party will table its political agenda the meeting sunday morning jumping the gun here say,1
 love when people defending islam and when countered with facts silent ,1
seriously did you expect him talk sense issues about indian kulcha ,0
encouraging devadasi system will sure bring down rape problem bajapa,1
date feb 2012 come you can try harder how did let you down when this public knowledge for years let answer own question this isn about you being let down since you weren modi supporter anyways this about slowly chipping away his power base sow needless doubts peoples minds really don care much about these little things fine supports homepathy long the vast majority things does are good know one perfect willing give him some leeway these silly things ,1
 know the current science says bullshit but thing works for and everyone family when was had chronic joint pain that refused away for months after using homeopathic remedy the effect was immediate there was gradual reduction pain within hours and week gone completely have used homeopathic remedies for many other things after that and the results were more than satisfactory another thing want say the current science doesn have explanation for everything have explored nothing also big pharma the big mafia downvote this all you want but just wanted share experience ,1
better than pumping shit load anti biotics chemicals strong medicines for simple ailments babies,1
this thread farce the mods themselves rather their friends and alt accounts are the biggest political propgandists bigots and trolls india yet these accounts never face any action and instead when reported mods bend over backwards defend them against the complainants and attack the latter ,0
hopefully whole bunch modi haters will automatically hate homeopathy now thats the only this,0
love jihad fact even college mechanical students are taking our girls not ,1
 listing alleged incidents meerut faizabad and ghaziabad bajpai said “have they got the certificate rape girls because they belong particular religion ” what load horseshit guess most notorious rape cases this country were all from these religiously licensed communities right sure why can the population commit the rapes that sounds legit man the level which these bigots will for votes and politics has fucking limits making issues like sexual harassment and rape religious one the lowest form politics one can play but then again what can you expect from this fucking toad bjp can survive without anti muslim rhetoric they need hindu votes and hindus can unite internally unlike muslims they probably are too busy give shit which good getting them hate each other all they have got all this development and vibrant nonsense will crystal clear next 5yrs and they fully aware which point divide and conquer will and has worked best they know ,1
this saddening hear again and again they are slowly demonizing the whole muslim community gain votes and get into power why the fuck can they stick the development mantra and read this know about who were raped and who got sheltered ,0
this hopeless bigotry will live and continue keep sections society apart since when rape religious problem have there been recorded rapes from hindu communities and panchayats divisive rhetoric like this will get you votes the short term but will absolutely fracture unity the long term why can they simply stick accomplishments and policies ,1
what kind sick fucks exist this country who are willing look the other way when the ruling entity the country blatantly labeling whole religion rapists based the crimes few really are you that blind did you not get educated look people people and not members ascribing faith what poor faculty tolerance and then they act all miffed when you lament that the country isn improving mind you all bad the hindu muslim murderers and rapists who believe okay kill people based who they worship just because your bigotry hasn reduced barbaric violence now doesn mean never will fact means there much higher chance you being the first people join violent movement against some other religion sick fucktards the entire lot you and don give that shit about having holier than thou attitude normal you the unevolved barbaric hordes living way out the time when the majority the population was like you ,0
this good way they now are upfront about what they stand for sneaky agenda packaged with other bigger idea like search toolbar addons also wonder what modi thinks about this strategy wait remember this just footpath politics nevermind ,1
for those who think homeopathy alternative medicine please watch this bbc documentary why homeopathy rebuked medicine vcbhkmjdhau and are talking about modi believing british royal family has been staunchest supporter homeopathy since 1830 expect people higher position rational sadly its not always the case ,0

 welp guess can just delete the text file had snooze you lose guess thanks for posting though ,1
thanks goes you and everyone else that have been doing these recaps haven been able watch the last few days ,1
 the only one who just figured the wizard idea medium would end being huge pictured their medium being slightly smaller than nade new castle and tom being smart buying nade castle owes nade more than diamonds but nade was fine getting castle plus nade got the full amount back could make armor weapons potentially use against tom eventually like the idea diamonds being used but they rare and valuable yet people want many things built that don like the idea the wizards wasting them rather the wizards almost place bets people giving them random pieces armor gear almost like hunger games sponsorship ifirez thinks sonja underpowered can pull out diamonds enchant sword and give her sparklez needs stripmine wizard who wants him succeed can offer diamond pickaxe exchange for all the stone and other basic blocks acquires with obviously they don actually need but for purposes ,1
 been bjp supporter for these elections but this pretty damning evidence they should not allowed form state government the current assembly under any circumstance for what its worth still think aap idealist politics positive much smaller level such the municipal level but their uber socialist economics destructive legislative level rather see them take over the municipal corporation ,1
 bjp has decided not defend sher singh implying that the video very likely real and yet all the msm channels tuned chose ignore the press conference need more proof the governments influence over media ,1
apparently bjp delhi pulled down their site for short while after this vid came out delete all pics sher singh with bjp bigshots afaik this sher singh guy has shady property biz the side and well connected rss edit sher singh dagar wikipedia page has been deleted lol ,1
this just sad this video true sher singh didn deny its authenticity then shows how brazenly the bjp trying poach this mla the saddest part that don think anything will come out this bjp might still manage cobble together government taking support from congress don put past them waiting for the supreme court hearing tomorrow which will hopefully give decisive answer this whole drama the fact the matter and what people seem ignore that there corruption everywhere around this shouldn come surprise ,0
 phone but the video there the article isn public yet also who actually doubted that the bjp was going these things for all their development agenda they hardly wear your heart your sleeve kinda party ,0
and there are some commenter twitter and elsewhere who are saying things like modi should intervene etc they really think the guy who spent 5000 crores black money win the elections thinks what happened here wrong probably will punish the guy for getting caught and the bjp wallahs will say our modi great doesn tolerate this when the opposite the truth recent tweet kejriwal bjp expels dagar will they also expel all those who appear future stings don think they have any more videos but guess any other bjp mlas members who made similar offers must shitting their pants right now ,1
hope supreme court provides due justice ,0
the question remains where earth they get crores buy out mlas and they even have the procedure collecting money discreetly down routine the bjp guy explains the video towards the end bjp this case but even congress has been accused horse trading with their crores the past,0
what clusterfuck hope this breaks the only bjp honest and clean and can wrong circlejerks and whataboutx not valid argument ,1
 one thing that most people missed sher singh says shaam tak sab cheez clear jayegi aap kahenge hame aapki tasveer india tak show jayegi rajat sharma did show exposing kejriwal 2vhipvnuh after kejriwal alledged that india one those channels who have been given contract attack aap loosely translated ,1
timesnow initially used the hashtag now they are using guess they realized there only much bulllshit they can peddle before they completely lose credibility edit tweet from vishal dadlani like they pooped their pants everyone knows but they still trying hide their friends aren saying word ,1
the electorate have decision make aap elect party which resigned and threw away their 2nd position mandate for the center had plan how they would get have experience governing but hare pretty good playing antics that borderline crazy bjp elect party that has learned from the congress how play dirty politics and let shit remain the same dressed different color congress elect party that are the masters the politics dirty game again and accept someone like dixit good luck delhi ,1
putting the sham sher singh ,0
how stupid can bjp have any such conversations with aap members ,0
there are more numerically morally and also financially worth more rhinos assam than aap mla ,1
but this the raw video has any edits been made what proof there that this real \ itt aap circlejerkers who whine about other circlejerks ,0
 good thing the bjp will not try enter the delhi govt via backdoor think now they are afraid even more videos coming out everyone will afraid cameras whenever they such things now even cameras are not required everyone has mobile phone nowadays would say the bjp just fucked their chances delhi ,0
 summary like ask simple question right wingers you defend this move senior leader bjp you then apparently everything alright politics and you shouldn criticize the hypocritical actions aap even they projected themselves honest people because that hypocritical you you don but still support bjp then what right you have question the supporters aap quoting every single gaffe they ever done either case your stand illogical and doesn make sense ,1
this sad ,0
